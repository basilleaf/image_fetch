Different layers have different colors.

Bright dust has been scoured from the surface by strong southerly winds (blowing from the top right in these unprojected images). Bright streaks trail downwind from impact craters, protected from the wind in the lee of the crater rims. Sharp dark streaks edged upwind as the dust was stripped away. At least two different episodes of erosion with slightly different wind directions can be inferred from the orientations of the dark streaks. Yet another wind direction is indicated by the few dune-like ripples that can be seen in the floor of the valley. These features were shaped by much older winds that were probably controlled by local topography. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2012/details/cut/ESP_016700_2075_2.jpg\">  <strong>   The second subimage  </strong> </a> shows the second erosion process, the tracks of dust-devils across the newly cleaned surface (just south of the first subimage). What makes these tracks interesting is that they are bright! Most dust-devil tracks on Mars are dark, forming when a whirlwind lifts bright dust off the surface and exposes a darker substrate. These tracks were neither visible in the earlier HiRISE image, nor in an earlier image ( <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002222_2075\">  <strong>   PSP_002222_2075  </strong> </a> ) acquired in January, 2007. The cause of the bright tracks is unclear. <br/> <br/> Bright dust-devil tracks were also spotted by the Mars Orbital Camera in southern Schiaparelli Crater, a region also dominated at the time by wind streaks. One way to make bright tracks would be to excavate through dark material (such as a lag of basaltic sand) to a brighter substrate. Another possibility is that the dust-devils stir up the remaining pockets of bright dust that are hiding from the prevailing winds in the shelter of topographic obstacles. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler   (29 August 2012) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016700_2075\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016700_2075</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016700_2075", "id": 1195, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_016700_2075.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1195/", "slug": "changing-mars", "title": "Changing Mars"}, {"content": "<a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://uahirise.org/images/2012/details/cut/ESP_028335_1755_IRB.NOMAP-2x.jpg\">  <strong>   This color-enhanced view  </strong> </a> shows the terrain around the rover's landing site within Gale Crater on Mars.

In cold regions of Earth, polygonal cracks like this usually indicate ground ice. <br/> <br/> The scalloped depressions (or \"scallops\") generally have a steep \"pole-facing\" scarp and a gentle \"equator-facing\" slope. Scallop formation may be due to the degradation of ice-rich subsurface material by sublimation (process of ice going directly from a solid state to a gas state). On scallop floors, we often see nested series of curvilinear ridges that probably point to earlier locations of the scarp and contribute to the \"shell-like\" appearance. <br/> <br/> Scallops are observed in other areas of the Martian mid-latitudes (40 to 60 degrees) in both northern and southern hemispheres. They probably represent a form of degradation that erodes an ice-rich mantle thought to have been deposited by precipitation during periods of high obliquity (the tilt of the Martian axis of rotation relative to the plane of Mars' orbit). These features add weight to the evidence that water ice has been a dynamic component of the Martian sub-surface during recent geological ages and they they may slowly be continuing their development at the present time. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alexandra Lefort   (29 October 2008) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010034_2250\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010034_2250</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010034_2250", "id": 513, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_010034_2250.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/513/", "slug": "polygon-network-and-scalloped-depressions-in-weste", "title": "Polygon Network and Scalloped Depressions in Western Utopia Planitia"}, {"content": "While HiRISE has imaged slope streaks before, bright streaks are not as common as dark ones, so they're of high interest. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2012/details/cut/ESP_022405_1910.jpg\">  <strong>   Slope streaks are generally small features  </strong> </a> , and have an interior roughness that is finer than the width of the streak itself.

A great deal of geologic activity is needed to transform an impact crater into a trough crater. First, the crater must have been filled in with some type of sediment. Second, the outer edge of the filling must have been scooped out by an unknown process, leaving a trough in the form of a ring inside the crater. <br/> <br/> The trough in this observation is located on the North wall of the Southern end of the trough crater. Gullies can be seen to start at multiple levels on this wall. The Martian gullies are thought to require some amount of liquid water to form, although carbon dioxide and dry debris flows have also been suggested as erosional materials. The start of gullies across Mars are often correlated with layers as seen here. What is particularly interesting about these gullies is that the heads (tops) of the gullies are located at many elevations along the same slope, and that each elevation with gullies has an associated set of layers. <br/> <br/> One thing to notice is that often a layer correlated with a gully is most eroded where the gully occurs. (See, for example, the gullies located in the bottom center of the image <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002390_1320_cut_b.jpg\">  and the subimage, </a> ). At the bottom center, there are two gullies present, and the layer where they appear to originate is most eroded where the gullies exist. In the subimage, the deeper gully channels correspond to locations where the layers have been more eroded. This suggests that undermining may be occurring. Undermining often happens when water from the subsurface reaches the surface and destabilizes nearby material. The water erodes material in its way, which can create an overhang. Once this overhang becomes unstable, it will collapse. <br/> <br/> This might be the reason that the layers are the most eroded near the gullies. It would support a subsurface origin for the water that formed these gullies. Undermining can also be generated by surface water if a weak, easily erodible layer lies beneath a stronger layer. <br/> <br/> For more information, see Gulick, V.C. et al.

Unfortunately, the finest layering and details are not visible because the Martian atmosphere above Crommlin Crater at this time was dusty, making a clear image difficult for the HiRISE camera to obtain. Within the regular sequence of layering, however, a pattern of several fine layers separated by single thicker, or darker, layers are apparent. This repeating pattern may indicate that the conditions in which the sediments were originally deposited repeated over time. <br/> <br/> Crommlin Crater is especially interesting because it is located very close to Meridiani Planum, which is where the MER Opportunity Rover has been exploring layered rocks up close. Comparison of nearby layers studied from the rover on the ground and from the spacecraft above will provide greater insight into the age and origin of these deposits.Written by: Patrick Russell   (5 August 2007) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004421_1850\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004421_1850</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004421_1850", "id": 1262, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1152/PSP_004421_1850.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1262/", "slug": "layering-in-crommlin-crater", "title": "Layering in Crommlin Crater"}, {"content": "This image was featured in MOC Image R09-00388. <br/> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/\">  <strong>   Mars Global Surveyor MOC Image Gallery  </strong> </a> .(29 July 2009) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010397_1725\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010397_1725</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010397_1725", "id": 632, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_010397_1725.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/632/", "slug": "light-toned-rock-exposures-in-noctis-labyrinthus", "title": "Light-Toned Rock Exposures in Noctis Labyrinthus"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004311_1050\"></div>This full HiRISE image shows layers exposed on the scarp that bounds the south polar layered deposits.

This irregular wavy appearance may have been caused by the flow of  ice at some point, although it is currently too cold on Mars for significant flow to be occurring today. <br/> <br/> Layers near the top of the image appear to be converging and some of the lower layers appear truncated. Geologists call this an unconformity, as it indicates that there was a previous episode of erosion that removed material down to the truncated layers. Subsequent deposition then built this stack of ice back up to its current thickness. Features like this, as well as the layers themselves, can help planetary scientists figure out what past climates on Mars may have been like.Written by: Shane Byrne (via Nathan Bridges)   (2 August 2007) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004720_1050\" title=\"PSP_004720_1050\">   PSP_004720_1050  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004311_1050\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004311_1050</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004311_1050", "id": 1263, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1152/PSP_004311_1050.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1263/", "slug": "basal-exposure-of-south-polar-layered-deposits", "title": "Basal Exposure of South Polar Layered Deposits"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004434_1885\"></div>This HiRISE image shows part of an extensive series of layered materials in a crater in Arabia Terra. The crater is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) in diameter and mostly filled with layered rocks, which are common throughout the area. <br/> <br/> This image covers a swath of the crater from the center to the rim; the rim is at the northern edge (top). The northernmost layered materials are exposed as small buttes and stacks of layers, forming circular or elongated knobs. Further south, the appearance of the layers changes, forming more expansive outcrops with a few small knobs. This could be due to a change in the properties of the layers at given levels of the crater; materials of various strengths may erode at different rates. It might also reflect local slopes or erosional processes. This area looks darker-toned from a distance, but this appears to be due to partial covering of some of the layers by dark sand. A large sheet of sand is visible at the southern (bottom) edge of the image. <br/> <br/> Many small faults are visible throughout the layers, expressed as small discontinuities and offsets; these indicate places where tectonic stresses have caused the layered deposits to break and shift. <br/> <br/> The origin of such layers is not certain. Materials a few hundred kilometers away have been explored by <a href=\"http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/home/\">  NASA's Opportunity rover, </a> and are sandstone formed by ancient dunes; the same could be true at this site, as sandstone on Earth often forms extensive layered deposits. Other possibilities include ancient lake or ocean sediments or volcanic airfall deposits. It is possible that multiple processes contributed to the rocks here, but the regularity of layering suggests a single repeated process.

Erosion has exposed lower terrains with a rougher pitted texture. <br/> <br/> Several areas are crossed by a network of cracks forming polygons. These features are similar to permafrost (permanently frozen) polygons that form in periglacial regions on Earth by seasonal-to-annual contraction of the subsoil. They are indicative of the presence of ground ice, so it is likely that the landforms we observe here are related to the presence of interstitial ice in the subsurface.  (Periglacial means occurring or operating adjacent to the margin of  a glacier.) <br/> <br/> The erosional process of these terrains starts with the development of oval- to scalloped-shaped depressions that typically have a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentler equator-facing slope. Several of these depressions may coalesce together, leading to the formation of large areas of pitted terrain. <br/> <br/> The texture of these terrains suggests that the main formation process is sublimation, which is the process of a material going directly from a solid state to a gaseous state. At this latitude on Mars, the conditions of pressure and temperature allow water ice within the ground to sublime. The disappearance of the ice component of the ground probably leads to the formation of depressions. This process may still be active today.Written by: Alexandra Lefort   (25 July 2007) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005408_1235\" title=\"PSP_005408_1235\">   PSP_005408_1235  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004340_1235\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004340_1235</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004340_1235", "id": 1266, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1152/PSP_004340_1235.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1266/", "slug": "scalloped-depressions-in-peneus-patera", "title": "Scalloped Depressions in Peneus Patera"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005342_1225\"></div>This image reveals depressions in the mid-latitude mantle within a crater at Peneus Patera. <br/> <br/> The depressions, several of which have coalesced together, have scalloped edges.

Because Mars is so much colder however, carbon dioxide ice is deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring, analogous to winter-time water ice/snow on Earth. <br/> <br/> Around the South Pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter; this persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south pole residual cap. The retention of carbon dioxide ice throughout the year by the southern polar cap is one characteristic that distinguishes it significantly from Mars' North polar cap. <br/> <br/> As can be seen in this HiRISE image of the South Pole residual cap, relatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by circular, oval, and blob-shaped depressions. This patterned terrain is called \"swiss cheese\" terrain. The high-standing areas are carbon dioxide ice with thicknesses of several to approximately 10 meters. The depressions are thought to be caused by the removal of this carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). As most depressions seem to have relatively flat floors, there is likely some layer below, possibly made of water ice, that cannot be as easily removed by sublimation. Complicated shapes arise when neighboring growing depressions intersect. <br/> <br/> A previous Mars imaging system, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), took images of the same places on the south pole residual cap every year for many years, and showed that there are annual changes taking place within it. By looking at different sizes and shapes of depressions in an image such as this, and by comparing images of the same place from year to year, the development of \"swiss cheese\" terrain can be described. The sublimation process may begin as a small, shallow depression in a smooth surface. This depression then deepens until reaching the resistant layer below, and continues to expand laterally in all directions, creating the generally round depressions we see today. Different heights and thicknesses of smooth areas, and different depths of depressions, may indicate that multiple episodes of accumulation and sublimation have occurred. <br/> <br/> This is one of the locations previously monitored at lower resolution by MOC. With the high resolution and repeat-imaging capability of HiRISE, we intend to continue monitoring and better measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over one or more Mars years. This is one of the locations specifically targeted by HiRISE for this purpose. <br/> <br/> Knowing the amount and rate of carbon dioxide removal can give us a better idea of the role of carbon dioxide (the main component of the Martian atmosphere) in polar and atmospheric processes, of current environmental and climatic conditions, and of how Mars climate may be changing. <br/> <br/> In HiRISE images such as this one, it is evident on the slopes of the large, especially high mesa just above the center of the image that the carbon dioxide-rich material may be constructed of several individual horizontal layers. However, it also appears that as erosion eats into the mesa, pieces of a stronger mesa surface layer break off and are left strewn on the mesa slopes, where they may give the appearance of layering. <br/> <br/> An interesting feature in this HiRISE image is the crisscrossing network of faint ridges and troughs on the upper smooth terrain. These may also be complexly involved in the sublimation and deposition of carbon dioxide ice. <br/> <br/> Written by: Patrick Russell   (8 December 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005095_0935\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005095_0935</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005095_0935", "id": 164, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_005095_0935.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/164/", "slug": "south-pole-residual-cap-swiss-cheese-terrain-monit", "title": "South Pole Residual Cap Swiss-Cheese Terrain Monitoring"}, {"content": "The full observation is of an area covering MOC Images E04-02179 and E11-03026.(12 August 2009) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002066_1425\" title=\"PSP_002066_1425\">   PSP_002066_1425  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001578_1425\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001578_1425</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001578_1425", "id": 655, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_001578_1425.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/655/", "slug": "gullies-incised-on-crater-wall", "title": "Gullies Incised on Crater Wall"}, {"content": "Scientists on the HiRISE team have discovered never-before-seen impact \"megabreccia\" and a possibly once-habitable ancient lake on Mars at a place called Holden Crater. <br/> <br/> The megabreccia is topped by layers of fine sediments that formed in what apparently was a long-lived, calm lake that filled Holden crater on early Mars, HiRISE scientists say. <br/> <br/> Holden crater has some of the best-exposed lake deposits and ancient megabreccia known on Mars,\" said HiRISE's principal investigator, professor Alfred McEwen of the UA's <a href=\"http://www.lpl.arizona.edu\">  <strong>   Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.  </strong> </a> Both contain minerals that formed in the presence of water and mark potentially habitable environments. This would be an excellent place to send a rover or sample-return mission to make major advances in understanding if Mars supported life. <br/> <br/> Holden Crater is an impact crater that formed within an older, multi-ringed impact basin called Holden Basin. Before an impact created Holden crater, large channels crossed and deposited sediments in Holden Basin. <br/> <br/> Blocks as big as 50 meters across were blasted from Holden Basin when Holden Crater formed, then fell chaotically back to the surface and eventually formed \"megabreccia,\" a conglomeration of large, broken boulders mixed with smaller particles. HiRISE images show megabreccia outcrops in Holden Crater walls. This megabreccia may be some of the oldest deposits exposed on the surface of Mars. <br/> <br/> At least 5 percent, by weight, of the fine sediments in the layer on top of the megabreccia consists of clay, according to another instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, or CRISM. <br/> <br/> \"The origin of the clays is uncertain, but clays in the probable lake sediments implies quiescent conditions that may preserve signatures of a past habitable environment,\" HiRISE co-investigator John Grant of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum said. \"If we were looking on Earth for an environment that preserves signatures related to habitability, this is one of the kinds of environments we would look at.\" <br/> <br/> And even the clay-containing layers aren't all that's icing the cake. Topping the clay layers that formed in the placid Holden crater lake are layers of great boulder-filled debris unleashed later, when water breached Holden crater rim, creating a torrential flood that eroded the older lake sediments. <br/> <br/> The clay-rich layers would have remained buried from view, except for that great piece of luck, the fact that Holden Crater rim could no longer withstand the force of an estimated 4,000 cubic kilometers of water dammed behind it. The body of water would have been larger than Lake Huron. <br/> <br/> \"The volume of water that poured through during this flood must have been spectacular,\" Grant said. \"It ripped up finely bedded materials, including blocks 70 meters or 80 meters across --  blocks nearly the size of football fields.\" <br/> <br/> The first, prolonged watery episode at Holden Crater that settled out the fine-grain sediments probably lasted at least thousands of years. By contrast, the second lake, formed when the crater rim was breached, may have lasted only hundreds of years, not long at all, Grant said. <br/> <br/> The megabreccia excavated when Holden Crater formed is the first found on Mars, Grant said. \"When large craters form, they produce very large blocks of material. We see them on Earth. Popigai Crater in Russia is one example. But we'd never seen them on Mars, and we knew they ought to be there. Now weve seen them with HiRISE.\" <br/> <br/> The observations suggest that the clays originally could have formed before the impact created Holden crater in the older Holden Basin. Many of the blocks in the megabreccia appear to erode more easily than the surrounding crater wall material. These blocks could be chunks of Holden basin sediments that predate the impact crater, Grant said. \"These blocks could be derived from the earlier Holden basin that were excavated on impact, then later re-eroded, with the sediments settling to the bottom of the long-lived lake. It's intriguing to think the clays we see in Holden crater now might actually have been recycled.\" <br/> <br/> Holden Crater is one of six remaining landing site candidates for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, a mission scheduled for launch in 2011. <br/> <br/> So far, most evidence for sustained wet conditions on Mars is limited to the planet's earliest history, the HiRISE scientists say. While water certainly flowed over the planet later in its history, it may have flowed only in short-lived, or catastrophic events. <br/> Written by: Lori Stiles   (22 December 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003077_1530\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003077_1530</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003077_1530", "id": 180, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_003077_1530.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/180/", "slug": "megabreccia-at-holden-crater", "title": "Megabreccia at Holden Crater"}, {"content": "This image shows part of a relatively small (14 kilometers, or 9 miles across) unnamed impact crater in Noachis Terra.

Another possible interpretation is that fine-grained rocky material mixed with air and formed the rampart pattern in the absence of water. <br/> <br/> The gullies shown in this image are similar to terrestrial gullies produced by flowing water. The current Martian climate would not allow for liquid water to be stable at the surface for extended periods of time, though. It is so cold (in the order of -70 C or -90 F) that the water would freeze, and then it would sublimate quickly, because the air is very dry and thin (the atmospheric pressure is on average less than 1/100 of that on Earth).

Oriented roughly east-west and located north of the Argyre impact basin, its western region contains numerous short, theater-headed tributaries that merge into a long, sinuous, and deeply entrenched main valley that extends eastward to Uzboi Vallis. <br/> <br/> The area in this image (centered at -27.1730 latitude, 313.7340 longitude) is of the western most tributaries. Valley heads are steep and abrupt with blunt terminations. Although Nirgall Vallis formed long ago, likely by flowing water, abundant wind-blown sediments transformed into the dune fields that now line the valley floors. However, the distinctive valley pattern shape with steep walls and flat floors led many to propose that ground water flowed out to the surface along the valley heads and walls of the numerous tributaries. This process, known as sapping, begins with ground water flowing along subsurface fractures or permeable layers and carrying out sediments with it as it emerges at the cliff face. <br/> <br/> Eventually, the loss of support from beneath undermines the cliff face, causing it to slump into the valley. With continued sapping, tributaries grow progressively in a headward direction. This kind of erosion is common in the Colorado Plateau of the Southwestern United States and helped form the distinctive shape of the Grand Canyon. Wrinkle ridges intersecting several tributaries may have provided additional avenues for ground water flow into the valley system. <br/> <br/> Written by: Ginny Gulick   (20 November 2013) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034091_1525\" title=\"ESP_034091_1525\">   ESP_034091_1525  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033814_1525\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033814_1525</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033814_1525", "id": 2615, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_033814_1525.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2615/", "slug": "nirgal-vallis-tributaries", "title": "Nirgal Vallis Tributaries"}, {"content": "This observation shows a lava plain near the Martian equator.

Compared to the rest of the lava flow, these two raised areas are cold at night and warm in the day. This property of the surface, where the temperature changes quickly, is called “low thermal inertia.”  Rocks tend to have relatively high thermal inertia, so this is unexpected. <br/> <br/> This image confirms speculation from earlier, lower resolution images. The rafts are composed of broken up (brecciated) lava, forming an extraordinarily rough surface. Normally, such a jagged pile of lava rocks would have high thermal inertia.  But in this location, the rough surface has served as a trap for wind-carried dust. Thus in these rafts, and only in these rafts, is the lava covered by a thick pile of fluffy dust. <br/> <br/> Such dust is extremely insulating, meaning that all the solar heating is deposited in a very thin layer near the surface. Therefore, dust gets relatively hot during the day. Because the heat is deposited so shallowly, it is easily lost at night. So, the trapped dust is the explanation for the low thermal inertia of these lava rafts. <br/> <br/> Written by: Lazlo Kestay (audio by Tre Gibbs)   (13 November 2013) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033556_1890\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033556_1890</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033556_1890", "id": 2619, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_033556_1890.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2619/", "slug": "rafts-of-lava-with-strange-infrared-properties", "title": "Rafts of Lava with Strange Infrared Properties"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033252_2070\"></div>Many types of craters exist on Mars.

Consistent with this interpretation is the fact that the cluster is located along a line between the Curiosity landing site and a strewn field of debris previously identified in HiRISE images as being caused by MSL hardware, in particular  the cruise stage and/or tungsten weights used as cruise balance masses (see the caption for <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://uahirise.org/ESP_029245_1755\">  <strong>   ESP_029245_1755  </strong> </a> and associated links). <br/> <br/> Over a year has passed since the landing, so this impact cluster is not as fresh as those imaged earlier and has been degraded somewhat by winds from the northeast. Nevertheless, the cluster shows some similarities to the impacts up-range, including asymmetric ejecta patterns that indicate an oblique impact (estimated to be only 9 to 10 degrees above horizontal).

In contrast, the up-range impacts included four craters that were 4 to 5 meters in diameter. Assigning each of the impacts to specific pieces of hardware is a challenging puzzle, but it is thought that the four large craters were produced by two large tungsten weights that broke in half to make these four craters, or by pieces of the cruise stage, which was designed to break up in the atmosphere for planetary protection purposes, to kill any Earthly microbes. <br/> <br/> The cluster imaged here adds to the mystery, and may have been produced by a piece of the cruise stage that travelled farther through the Martian atmosphere and was therefore more thoroughly fragmented by the time it crashed onto the surface. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler (audio by Tre Gibbs)   (16 October 2013) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033293_1755\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033293_1755</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033293_1755", "id": 2629, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_033293_1755.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2629/", "slug": "possible-impacts-from-msl-hardware", "title": "Possible Impacts from MSL Hardware"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017174_1730\"></div><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://uahirise.org/images/2013/details/cut/ESP_017174_1730.jpg\">  <strong>   This beautiful image  </strong> </a> shows terrific layers and exposed bedrock along a cliff in west Candor Chasma, which is part of the extensive Valles Marineris canyon system. <br/> <br/> A Context Camera (CTX) image of this area showed that the strata is not entirely horizontal, and that there may be crossed beds, or lenses pinching out, or some other texture/structure that might give a clue as to the depositional setting of the sediment that makes up these layers. <br/> <br/> This image shows the area in greater detail and resolution, so we can compare what we have gleaned from CTX and MOC images to develop a better understanding of what we're looking at and how to interpret the past history of the region. <br/> <br/> Written by: HiRISE Science Team (audio by Tre Gibbs)   (16 October 2013) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017174_1730\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017174_1730</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017174_1730", "id": 2630, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_017174_1730.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2630/", "slug": "bedding-details-in-layered-rock", "title": "Bedding Details in Layered Rock"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017154_1390\"></div>This observation shows an excellent example of what is called “fretted terrain,” termed so because of the eroded appearance of the surface. <br/> <br/> What causes this kind of terrain?

This moderately sized crater possesses a fluid-like ejecta blanket, which is typically referred to as layered ejecta. <br/> <br/> The term layered ejecta is used because it is less suggestive then fluidized, which suggests that water is involved. There is an ongoing debate as to whether this type of ejecta is formed from  ices or fluids in the target, may be a consequence of interactions between the ejecta and the atmosphere,or both. <br/> <br/> Sante Fe Crater is located about 150 kilometer South of the Viking Lander 1 site in Chryse Planitia. Because this is a well-preserved impact crater, the high-resolution image here captures several important aspects of larger impact craters in general and large layered ejecta type craters in particular. <br/> <br/> The crater is covered in this image from its central peak on the west edge of the image to almost the crater rim on the East side, and North and South onto the ejecta surface beyond the crater rim. The margins of the ejecta that are  characteristic of this type of crater are not visible in this observation, but have been imaged by HiRISE ( <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_012795_1995\">  <strong>   ESP_012795_1995  </strong> </a> ).

Throughout the image, and particularly along the base of slopes and scarps there are numerous small ridges. These are dunes, much younger than- and unrelated to  the formation of the crater. <br/> <br/> Santa Fe Crater takes its name from Santa Fe, New Mexico. (The convention for naming craters on Mars states that some craters may be named after towns with populations smaller than 100,000.) During the Viking Landing site selection in 1976, early Viking Orbiter images were acquired of southern Chrsye Planitia near the outflow point of Kasei Vallis onto the Chryse plains. In honor of the 200th anniversary of the nation at that time, local craters near the landing site were named after towns important in the Nations founding. Santa Fe, was one of the first towns on the continent, so one of the craters was named after the town. <br/> <br/> Interestingly, the town of Santa Fe, New Mexico lies just 40 kilometers East of another young 20 kilometer-diameter crater, except this one is not an impact crater, but rather a giant volcanic caldera, the Vallis Caldera. <br/> <br/> Written by: Larry Crumpler and Livio Tornabene   (23 September 2009) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014351_1995\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014351_1995</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014351_1995", "id": 657, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_014351_1995.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/657/", "slug": "santa-fe-crater-impact-processes", "title": "Santa Fe Crater Impact Processes"}, {"content": "<strong>  UPDATED </strong> <br/> This image has an interesting perspective because of the oblique viewing geometry.

These were acquired in a particular sequence: first blue-green (BG), then RED, then infrared (IR), and the animation shows them in this sequence. <br/> <br/> What we see are thin condensate clouds moving relative to surface features. They appear to move 200 meters distance over the 0.1855 second between the infrared and blue-green imaging, or 1.08 kilometers per second! Wait, that's supersonic—can clouds do that? NO! <br/> <br/> The MRO spacecraft also moved 603 meters along its orbit in that 0.1885 second frame, so from 260 kilometers altitude, we have a stereo convergence angle of 0.133 degrees. Such a small convergence angle would be useless for stereo imaging of surface features up to only about 1 kilometer high, but clouds can be much higher. <br/> <br/> If the clouds were half as high as MRO (or 130 kilometers), they should appear to move 603 meters relative to surface features. Since they only moved 200 meters, their heights must be approximately 42 kilometers. Previous imaging experiments have measured Martian clouds up to 80 kilometers in height. High cirrus clouds on Earth extend up to about 12 kilometers in height, but the lower gravitational acceleration of Mars creates a more extended atmosphere. The high clouds on both Earth and Mars are composed of ice crystals, although on Mars they may be from carbon dioxide rather than dihydrogen monoxide (water). <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen   (29 January 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034342_1315\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034342_1315</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034342_1315", "id": 2639, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_034342_1315.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2639/", "slug": "high-altitude-clouds-on-mars", "title": "High-Altitude Clouds on Mars"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034829_1325\"></div>This image shows gullies that are large even by Mars standards, and much larger than the terrestrial landforms we call gullies.

Simply put, salts usually form by evaporation of liquid water. Most salts can easily dissolve in water, and if that water evaporates away completely, the salt is left behind as a deposit or residue. The larger the amount of salts initially dissolved, the larger the salt deposit left behind when the water evaporates. So when scientists look for regions on Mars that have noticeable salt deposits, they are effectively looking for areas that may have contained liquid water in the past. <br/> <br/> A few years ago, a group of scientists found more than 600 locations on Mars that may contain chloride salts, which could be very similar to  common table salt. Since then, scientists have been using the HiRISE camera to look at these locations more closely and they have found out that many of these locations are very similar to dried lakes on Earth, which are sometimes called “playas” or “salt pans.” Many such playas can be visited in California and Arizona such as the Racetrack playa and the Death Valley National Park. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_034309_1485.jpg\">  <strong>   In this image  </strong> </a> , the chlorides have a bright appearance and are covered by other dark materials. Interestingly, the bright deposits also display cracks that form polygonal patterns very similar to common mud cracks, which may be another indication that these deposits formed when salty waters evaporated away. Studying these regions in detail can help scientists understand when and how the weather conditions on Mars may have changed. <br/> <br/> Written by: Ramy El-Maarry   (15 January 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034309_1485\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034309_1485</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034309_1485", "id": 2645, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_034309_1485.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2645/", "slug": "looking-for-salts-on-mars", "title": "Looking for Salts on Mars"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034441_2565\"></div><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_034441_2565.jpg\">  <strong>   This image shows numerous dark shapes  </strong> </a> and bright spots on a sand dune in the Northern polar regions of Mars. <br/> <br/> The bright spots are carbon dioxide frost. On Mars, the main atmospheric component is carbon dioxide, which circulates seasonally between the atmosphere and the polar regions. One of the reasons that permit this process is the fact that temperatures on Mars are much colder than on Earth, which allows carbon dioxide frost to condense on the surface in winter. <br/> <br/> When spring comes however, the surface heats up and the carbon dioxide frost eventually sublimates (turns directly from the solid to the vapor state), and forms jets of carbon dioxide mixed with dust, leading to the formation of the dark features we see in the image. <br/> <br/> Such processes occur seasonally on Mars, and therefore are continuously being monitored by the HiRISE scientists to assess the differences from one year to the next. <br/> <br/> Written by: M.

These are a particular type of dune called a “barchan”, which forms when the wind blows in one direction (here, east to west) for long periods of time. Barchan dunes are common on Mars and in the desert regions of the Earth. <br/> <br/> These barchan dunes are located on the western rim of the Hellas impact basin, in the Southern Hemisphere of Mars. This area is covered by extensive deposits of layered rocks that were initially deposited as loose sediments and over time formed these rock layers. Portions of these layered rocks were subsequently eroded away and the remaining layers now form numerous flat-topped hills called “mesas”. The barchan dunes are forming in the lee (or downwind) of the mesas. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://uahirise.org/PSP_007676_1385\">  <strong>   This area was previously image by HiRISE in 2008  </strong> </a> and was retargeted here <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/hiwish\">  <strong>   through a public request via HiWish  </strong> </a> .

Mars’ obliquity is currently about 25 degrees, which is not much different from Earth's 23 degrees. However, numerical calculations by scientists at the <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.imcce.fr/Equipes/ASD/person/Laskar/Laskar.html\">  <strong>   Paris Observatory  </strong> </a> and <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://web.mit.edu/wisdom/www/mars-obliquity.pdf\">  <strong>   Massachusetts Institute of Technology  </strong> </a> suggest that this near-agreement is a coincidence. <br/> <br/> Under the influence of gravitational torques from other planets, Mars’ obliquity varies chaotically, probably reaching values greater than 60 degrees and lower than 10 degrees. By contrast, Earth’s obliquity appears to have been limited to small variations from its current value because of the stabilizing gravitational influence of the Moon. If the calculations are correct, then for most of the Solar System’s history, the obliquity of Mars was greater than 25 degrees. This would produce warmer summers and colder winters than on present-day Mars. On Earth, a recent 1 degree rise in obliquity is believed to have <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~phuybers/Doc/pace_nature2005.pdf\">  <strong>   triggered ice sheet retreat  </strong> </a> from the current location of New York City to Greenland. The climatic consequences of 50 degree changes in obliquity on Mars remain unknown. <br/> <br/> It is possible, though unproven, that <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.mars.asu.edu/christensen/advancedmarsclass/jakosky_carr_nature_85.pdf\">  <strong>   higher obliquity triggered partial melting  </strong> </a> of some of Mars’ water ice. Our best chance at understanding this is to find piles of ice, dust, silt or sand that accumulated over many cycles of obliquity change. Chemical, mineralogical and isotopic variations within those piles could then offer clues to about past climate changes. On Mars, sediment layers of near-uniform thickness visible from orbit are a fingerprint of deposits that <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~oa/publications/lewis2008_science.pdf\">  <strong>   record many cycles of obliquity change  </strong> </a> . <br/> <br/> This HiRISE image of an east-facing slope in Tithonium Chasma was taken to follow up an earlier Context Camera image that seemed to show sediment layers of near-uniform thickness. These sediment layers are the dark and light stripes that <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_034132_1750-1.jpg\">  <strong>   run diagonally across the center of the observation  </strong> </a> .

The dark and light stripes appear to deflect to the east (downslope) across the ridges. To a geologist, this outcrop pattern shows that the dip of the ancient sediment layers is gentler than the slope of the modern hillside. Further analysis of the image may determine whether these layers do record ancient obliquity-driven climate change on Mars. <br/> <br/> Written by: Edwin Kite (audio by Tre Gibbs)   (9 January 2014) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034554_1750\" title=\"ESP_034554_1750\">   ESP_034554_1750  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034132_1750\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034132_1750</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034132_1750", "id": 2649, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_034132_1750.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2649/", "slug": "the-obliquity-of-mars-periodic-bedding-in-tithoniu", "title": "The Obliquity of Mars (Periodic Bedding in Tithonium Chasma)"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034922_1385\"></div>This Southern autumn image captures a view of frosty dunes.

These sorts of bands suggest that the surface material has flowed and twisted viscously like taffy. The orientation of the ridges and groups of ridges would then <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_033995_1410.jpg\">  <strong>   point in the direction of the flow  </strong> </a> , called stream lines. <br/> <br/> Making this landscape even more complex is when we see that the ridges are sometimes disconnected. They stop abruptly, break up into blocky segments that sometimes appear offset. Such mixed up fragments give an initial sense that parts of the flow have been rafted apart from one another. Alternatively, the entire region may be substantially eroded since the time when the taffy-like ridges actually formed. In that case, the flow may have been far more complex and three dimensional, such that the disconnected portions are actually areas where the flow transitioned up and down relative to the current plane of the eroded surface. In this way we only see a slice through a far more complex series of twists and bends, some of which is still buried beneath the ground. <br/> <br/> What this taffy-like material is made of is currently unknown. Hard and soft rocks, as well as ice and ice-rich rocky debris, can deform and flow given time under the force of gravity and the pressures found deep beneath the surface. Afterwards, differential erosion of hard and soft rock or icy materials mixed in bands and layers might give rise to the ridges, furrows and pits which we observe today. <br/> <br/> Written by: Mike Mellon (audio by Tre Gibbs)   (9 January 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033995_1410\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033995_1410</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033995_1410", "id": 2650, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_033995_1410.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2650/", "slug": "banded-ridges-in-hellas", "title": "Banded Ridges in Hellas"}, {"content": "Amazingly, this HiRISE image has <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007338_2640_cut_b.jpg\">  <strong>   captured at least four avalanches,  </strong> </a> or debris falls, in action. <br/> <br/> The image to the left shows the context of where these avalanches occurred, with white boxes indicating the locations of the more detailed image portions shown to the right (all images are false color). Material, likely including fine-grained ice and dust and possibly including large blocks, has detached from a towering cliff and cascaded to the gentler slopes below. The occurrence of the avalanches is spectacularly revealed by the accompanying clouds of fine material that continue to settle out of the air. The largest cloud (upper images) traces the path of the debris as it fell down the slope, hit the lower slope, and continues downhill, forming a billowing cloud front. This cloud is about 180 meters (590 feet) across and extends about 190 m (625 ft) from the base of the steep cliff. Shadows to the lower left of each cloud illustrate further that these are three dimensional features hanging in the air in front of the cliff face, and not markings on the ground (sun is from the upper right). <br/> <br/> Cameras orbiting Mars have taken thousands of images that have enabled scientists to put together pieces of Mars geologic history. However, most of them reveal landscapes that havent changed much in millions of years. Some images taken at different times of year do show seasonal changes from one image to the next; however, it is extremely rare to catch such a dramatic event in action. (Another, unrelated, active process that has been captured by Mars cameras are dust devils.) Observing currently active processes is often a useful tool in unlocking puzzles of the past for scientists studying the Earth. Working from primarily still images, it is harder for scientists studying Mars to rely on this tool. The HiRISE image of avalanching debris is a very rare opportunity to directly do so. <br/> <br/> The scarp in this image is on the edge of the dome of layered deposits centered on Mars north pole. From top to bottom this impressive cliff is over 700 m (2300 ft) tall and reaches slopes over 60 degrees. The top part of the scarp, to the left of the images, is still covered with bright (white) carbon dioxide frost which is disappearing from the polar regions as spring progresses. The upper mid-toned (pinkish-brownish) section is composed of layers (difficult to see here) that are mostly ice with varying amounts of dust. The darkest deposits below form more gentle slopes, less than 20 degrees, and are mainly composed of two materials: mid-toned layers, possibly ice-rich, that form small shelves, and more mobile, widespread, sand-sized dark material. The wavy forms on the flatter areas to the right are dunes. <br/> <br/> The upper, steepest section, which appears highly fractured due to blocks pulling away from the wall, is the likely source zone for the falls. The precise trigger mechanism is not yet known, although the disappearance of the carbon dioxide frost, the expansion and contraction of the ice in response to temperature differences, a nearby Mars-quake or meteorite impact, and vibrations caused by the first fall in the area, are all possible contributors. <br/> <br/> By comparing images taken before the fall (such as <a <strong target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007140_2640\">  PSP_007140_2640 </a> ) and after the fall, we may be able to see where material has disappeared from the steep scarp and where it has appeared on the gentler slopes below, possibly as larger blocks, diffuse streaks, or other debris deposits. By imaging this scarp throughout the polar summer, we may be able to determine how much material falls over a given time period. These observations will help determine how much, and at what rate, ice is being eroded from the cliff. Understanding the processes and rates of erosion also help determine how the polar landscape has evolved, and help reveal how volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide ices and gases, move around Mars. <br/> <br/> The precise composition of the ice-dust mixture making up layers in the upper, steepest section of scarp is unknown. However, detailed measurements of the volume of material removed, the configuration of the source area, and the steepness of the slope can be used to estimate physical properties of the material that may relate to composition. <br/> <br/> Written by: Patrick Rusell   (14 March 2008) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007338_2640\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007338_2640</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007338_2640", "id": 306, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_007338_2640.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/306/", "slug": "caught-in-action-avalanches-on-north-polar-scarps", "title": "Caught in Action: Avalanches on North Polar Scarps"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033599_2160\"></div>This observation shows us a set of landforms that appears to form a nested “chevron” pattern on a slope in Coloe Fossae.

The brightness and color of these deposits are the result of different minerals within the rock relative to the nearby darker rocks and soils, and perhaps indicate extensive chemical interaction between water and the native rocks. <br/> <br/> Written by: HiRISE Science Team (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (12 March 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034942_1615\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034942_1615</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034942_1615", "id": 2653, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_034942_1615.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2653/", "slug": "craters-within-craters", "title": "Craters within Craters"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034941_2130\"></div>When impact craters are formed, the material that once resided in the subsurface is blown upward and outward. This material falls back and settles around the newly formed crater into what is called an “ejecta blanket.” It often appears as a layer on top of the original surface extending radially outward from the crater. <br/> <br/> In some cases the volume of the ejecta material— <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_034941_2130.jpg\">  <strong>   mainly rocky debris  </strong> </a> —appears to exceed the volume of the original crater, presenting something of a puzzle. One hypothesis is that the original surface may have been inflated with an ice-rich layer at the time of the impact. After the impact, the newly formed blanket of ejecta then protected this ice from evaporation loss, while the rest of the surrounding terrain was unprotected and deflated as ice was lost due to more recent climate changes. <br/> <br/> Examining these craters up close with HiRISE may reveal clues to the presence of buried ice deposits today beneath the ejecta, and about the subsurface stratigraphy exposed along the crater walls. <br/> <br/> Written by: Mike Mellon (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (12 March 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034941_2130\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034941_2130</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034941_2130", "id": 2654, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_034941_2130.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2654/", "slug": "ejecta-in-excess", "title": "Ejecta in Excess"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_035295_2670\"></div>A bright ice cap of frozen water covers the North Pole of Mars.

These are typical gullies with alcoves at the top, channels, and depositional fans at the bottom, but the alcoves are relatively small compared with many other mid-latitude gullies. HiRISE has shown that gullies are actively forming today in the southern mid-latitudes, aided by the seasonal deposition of carbon dioxide frost or dry ice. <br/> <br/> The equatorial gullies here appear pristine at the scale of HiRISE, with no superimposed craters or windblown deposits, so the gullies formed in the recent past and could still be forming today. Here in the Martian tropics, it is too warm for dry ice to help fluidize the movement of debris, but the slopes are probably steep enough for dry mass wasting to move dry particles, perhaps aided by water in the crust to reduce friction. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen and Colin Dundas (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (26 February 2014) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036275_1825\" title=\"ESP_036275_1825\">   ESP_036275_1825  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034864_1825\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034864_1825</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034864_1825", "id": 2660, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_034864_1825.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2660/", "slug": "equatorial-gullies", "title": "Equatorial Gullies"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_035189_2240\"></div>Small impact craters usually have simple bowl shapes, but sometimes more complicated shapes can occur if the target is unusual.

The third fault is the wavy ridge the cuts across both of the graben.

In HiRISE enhanced color, which operates in long infrared wavelengths (beyond what the human eye can detect), surfaces like these dune crests are dark blue to purple. Sand comes in sizes that are ideal for surface transport by the wind, where sand “hops” along forming bedforms, like these dunes after large amounts of time. <br/> <br/> The lighter toned “tan” or “reddish” surfaces are indeed composed of a different material, but not as sand sized particle that makes up the bulk of these dunes.  Rather, the light-toned smooth surfaces that dominate the lower, flatter areas of the dunes are a thin coating of global dust.  Dust on Mars is composed of a variety of materials, including oxidized iron, like rust. <br/> <br/> For a given wind gust, speeds are not constant at different heights.  Rather, wind speeds are greater with height above the ground and wind energy drops to nearly zero at the surface.  Dust persists on flatter dune areas, because wind energy there has not been sufficient to remove it, whereas “dust free” higher-lying dune crests are subject to more intense winds, which ultimately conspire to make the appearance of two-color  dunes. <br/> <br/> Written by: Matthew Chojnacki (audio: Melissa Dykhuis)   (9 April 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033483_1805\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033483_1805</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033483_1805", "id": 2678, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_033483_1805.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2678/", "slug": "two-color-dunes-in-meridiani-terra", "title": "Two-Color Dunes in Meridiani Terra"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_035807_1885\"></div>What is this strange-looking feature?

It is located south of Ascraeus Mons, which is a large volcano within the Tharsis volcanic plateau, so it is extremely likely that this feature was formed by a volcanic process. The feature rises above the surrounding terrain and we can see concentric ridges on its top. Perhaps this feature is an ancient vent structure (an opening in the ground from which volcanic lava emerges) that has been more resistant to erosion than the surrounding area, so that it resembles “inverted” terrains. <br/> <br/> Topographic inversion or inverted terrain often occurs when low areas of a landscape become filled with lava or sediments that harden into materials which are more resistant to erosion than the materials that surround them. Differential erosion then removes the less resistant surrounding material, leaving behind the younger resistant material which may then appear as a ridge where previously there was a valley, or in our case, a butte, where there was once a pit or depression. <br/> <br/> Additional imaging of the feature to create a stereo and a digital terrain model may help in further assessing the structure by making accurate measurement of its height and the steepness of its slopes. <br/> <br/> Written by: Ramy El-Maarry (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (9 April 2014) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036862_1885\" title=\"ESP_036862_1885\">   ESP_036862_1885  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_035807_1885\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_035807_1885</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_035807_1885", "id": 2679, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_035807_1885.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2679/", "slug": "a-heart-in-ascraeus-mons", "title": "A Heart in Ascraeus Mons"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_035702_2270\"></div>This image shows the western rim of a well-preserved 8.5-kilometer (about 5 miles) diameter impact crater. <br/> <br/> The wall features a slumped terrace that extends all the way around the crater diameter (the <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_025285_2270\">  <strong>   adjacent image show the rest of the terrace  </strong> </a> ).

However, when a circular depression is visible on the summit of a mound or an elevated landform in general, careful analysis is needed to identify whether the crater is created by an impact or by volcanic activity. <br/> <br/> This issue becomes even more problematic when the crater is located in a area known for its volcanic history such as the Apollinaris region where this image was taken and is very close to the prominent volcano Apollinaris Mons. <br/> <br/> In fact, this classical problem has been encountered before here on Earth in the case of the famous Meteor Crater in Arizona just outside of the city of Flagstaff. Back in the late 19th century, many people believed that Meteor Crater was a volcanic crater because of its proximity to the San Francisco volcanic field and the rarity of impact craters on Earth. <br/> <br/> Meteor Crater remained controversial until the 1960s when scientists were finally able to confirm that the crater was indeed an impact crater by identifying minerals in the crater site that can only form in extremely high pressures, which are usually associated with violent impact events. <br/> <br/> In the absence of such “ground truth” or lab analysis, how can planetary scientists differentiate between impact and volcanic craters? There are a number of ways. For example, impact craters usually exhibit raised rims and distinctive ejecta patterns around the crater, formed by materials ejected during the impact event. Large craters (more than 7 kilometers-wide in general for Mars) exhibit central peaks that form due the rebound of the ground right after impact. All these features are not usually observed in volcanic craters. In this observation, none of these features is visible.

What made the void space is not known, but one idea is that there were lenses of ice that slowly sublimated into the atmosphere. Another idea is that this is part of a sequence of crater fill and “exhumation”, that includes Gale Crater (home of the Curiosity rover). In other words, continued collapse and erosion of Asimov crater could eventually lead to a central mound like Eolis Mons (popular known as “Mt. Sharp”) in Gale Crater. However, at Asimov crater, the southern trough has destroyed the southern rim of the original crater, which didn’t happen at Gale Crater. <br/> <br/> Many of these steep trough slopes in Asimov crater, where facing the equator, have recurring slope lineae (RSL) activity in the summer when the sun-facing slopes get warm.

These features typically have a broad upslope alcove, feeding into a channel and apron of debris that has been carried from above. <br/> <br/> HiRISE has discovered many examples of activity in these gullies, likely driven by seasonal carbon dioxide (dry ice) frost. Images to look for such changes have been key targets for HiRISE in recent years, as we seek to understand the full range of surface processes that are active today. <br/> <br/> This area was targeted to look for changes in gullies previously covered by <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://uahirise.org/ESP_020051_1420\">  <strong>   ESP_020051_1420  </strong> </a> and <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://uahirise.org/ESP_013115_1420\">  <strong>   ESP_013115_1420  </strong> </a> .

Although we cannot pin down the season of this event, locations where HiRISE has been able to image more often demonstrate that this sort of event generally occurs in the winter, when liquid water is very unlikely.

OK, I don’t hear any cheering yet...you must be wondering “what the heck is a 3-sigma landing ellipse?” <br/> <br/> That’s a statistical prediction of where on Mars the rover might end up landing, given uncertainties such as atmospheric conditions during entry and descent. “3-sigma” means 3 standard deviations, so the rover was very, very likely (to about the 99.9% level) to land somewhere inside this ellipse. <br/> <br/> Such 3-sigma ellipses get a lot of scrutiny during landing site selection, because we don’t want anything dangerous like boulders or cliffs inside this ellipse during landing. Thus MSL didn’t try to land right at the base of Mount Sharp where the most interesting terrains lay (as seen from orbit), and spent almost exactly one Mars year roving (and exploring) until arriving at the edge of the ellipse. <br/> <br/> Maybe the landing-site aficionados are cheering now? Let’s try this: now that MSL is outside the safe-to-land ellipse, the landscape will get more interesting. The rover can drive around landscape features that would be dangerous to land on.

Called \"transverse aeolian ridges\", or TARs, the features stand up to 6 meters tall and are spaced a few tens of meters apart. They are typically oriented transverse to modern day wind directions, and often found in channels and crater interiors. The physical process that produces these features is still mysterious. Most TARs display no evidence of internal structure, so it is difficult to discern exactly how they were formed. <br/> <br/> While validating a HiRISE digital terrain model of the area, Sarah Mattson of the University of Arizona discovered these rare banded TARs in Iapygia, <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_020782_1610-1.jpg\">  <strong>   south of Syrtis Major  </strong> </a> . These features resemble TARs elsewhere on Mars, except that they show bands or layers on their northwest faces but fewer or none on the southeast sides. <br/> <br/> One possible interpretation of this strange layering is that these particular TARs are made up of wedge-shaped layers, as shown <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_020782_1610-2.jpg\">  <strong>   in the schematic cross-section  </strong> </a> illustrating the inferred structure of the TARs. If this hypothesis is correct, it implies that the ripples grew vertically over time, as material accreted at the crests of the ridges. It also suggests that the banded slopes faced upwind. <br/> <br/> This observation might provide a valuable clue to the formation of TARs elsewhere on Mars, if they have a similar internal structure but that structure cannot be seen because they are made up of homogeneous materials that are uniform in color. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler   (10 September 2014) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_021639_1610\" title=\"ESP_021639_1610\">   ESP_021639_1610  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020782_1610\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020782_1610</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020782_1610", "id": 2712, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_020782_1610.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2712/", "slug": "banded-tars-in-iapygia", "title": "Banded TARs in Iapygia"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_047502_1730\"></div>The steep walls of Valles Marineris sometimes fail, creating giant landslides.

Let’s try to explain this. <br/> <br/> First, there was a highly oblique impact event, with the bolide (or meteorite) striking the ground while flying almost horizontally over the surface. Such oblique impacts tend to send ejecta in two directions to the sides of the bolide trajectory, rather than in all directions around the crater.  However, there was ice near the surface, covered and protected by the ejecta, and the unprotected ice sublimated at some later time, so the ejecta now appears especially thick. <br/> <br/> Also, there were layers of dust (maybe along with ice) deposited inside the crater. Or maybe something else happened, but likely involving the ice that comes and goes in the middle latitude regions of Mars. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (27 August 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037237_1435\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037237_1435</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037237_1435", "id": 2717, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_037237_1435.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2717/", "slug": "weird-crater", "title": "Weird Crater"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037030_1880\"></div>One of the important roles of HiRISE is to take high resolution images of potential landing sites for future landing missions. <br/> <br/> This image is of an area called Aram Dorsum (also known by its old name, Oxia Palus) that has been suggested for the 2018/2020 ExoMars Rover, <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_037030_1880.jpg\">  <strong>   because it contains an ancient, exhumed alluvial system  </strong> </a> . <br/> <br/> Imaging is needed both to check for boulder fields and other obstacles, as well as checking the scientific justification for choosing a site.

This image has two particularly interesting features. One is that the surface dips into a depression towards the southwest, where the texture of the ice surface appears to change. The other is that there is a fracture or chain of pits in the southeast, which is a rare feature. <br/> <br/> The brightness, composition, texture, and small-scale features of this ice layer that covers most of the polar dome are important as they influence the local energy balance (such the amount of sunlight reflected and absorbed), which in turn influences polar-wide climate and the stability of ice. <br/> <br/> Written by: Patrick Russell   (16 July 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036867_2655\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036867_2655</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036867_2655", "id": 2728, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_036867_2655.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2728/", "slug": "the-icy-surface-of-the-north-polar-cap", "title": "The Icy Surface of the North Polar Cap"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036654_1490\"></div>Eridania Basin, located at the head of Ma’adim Vallis, has mounting geomorphic and spectral evidence that it may have been the site of an ancient inland sea. <br/> <br/> This site presents interesting mineralogical and geological evidence for the past existence of a large aqueous system on Mars that could have been long lived, and may have been well suited for ancient life, and almost certainly contains important clues about the ancient climate. <br/> <br/> In this HiRISE image, there are numerous dark ridges against a brighter substrate. These ridges could be cemented and topographically inverted fractures, although other origins (such as eskers, channels, or volcanic dikes) cannot be ruled out. One way to produce these ridges would be when fluids moved through the fractures, causing cementation and hardening. Later, erosion removed the softer rocks surrounding the fractures, while the more resistant cemented materials within the fractures were left standing higher, thus appearing inverted. <br/> <br/> Written by: Cathy Weitz   (16 July 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036654_1490\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036654_1490</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_036654_1490", "id": 2729, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_036654_1490.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2729/", "slug": "ridges-in-eridania-basin", "title": "Ridges in Eridania Basin"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032078_1420\"></div>This image covers a location that has been imaged several times to look for changes in gullies. <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_032078_1420.jpg\">  <strong>   The cutout shows a comparison  </strong> </a> between the first HiRISE image of the location and one of the more recent views. <br/> <br/> A lobate, rubbly flow (noted by the arrows) has been deposited near the mouth of the channel between the time of the two images.

Why are the ripples organized into two distinct wavelengths? Did the different wavelengths result from different processes or from different conditions? When did these wavelength-specific conditions or processes take place? Did they occur together, or did they alternate, or did one take place after the other?

However, sharper-looking features such as the crater and the <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008829_1735_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   long landslide scars  </strong> </a> (250 x 375 meters, or 270 x 410 yards) show that the fuzzy look is not an artifact of the image, but rather indicative of an extremely smooth surface. That smoothness is due to a thick layer of dust blanketing the landscape. <br/> <br/> How do we know this is dust? The lines of evidence below indicate that this is the case. <br/> <br/> Surface temperature measurements performed from satellites orbiting Mars show that these materials get relatively warm during the day (when they are illuminated by the Sun) and very cold at night. Rocks or sand would not experiment such large temperature oscillations between day and night. That is, dust has lower <a href=\"http://lasp.colorado.edu/inertia/\">  <strong>   thermal inertia  </strong> </a> than rocks and sand. <br/> <br/> Also, dust is uniformly bright (light) in color. Fine-grained materials are generally lighter in color that their coarser-grained counterparts, because of the way light is scattered (bounced) by fine particles. Martian dust has consistently a very light, reddish color, characteristic of the oxidized (rusty) iron in it. <br/> <br/> Another piece of evidence is that even though these materials are loose ( <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008829_1735_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   as shown by the landslides  </strong> </a> ), they are not movable by wind (demonstrated by the lack of <a href=\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/\">  <strong>   dunes  </strong> </a> . Wind does not move dust easily; stronger winds are needed to move dust alone than to move sand. This is because cohesive (sticky) forces between dust particles lock them into the surface. <br/> <br/> On Mars, where the air is approximately 1,000 times thiner than on Earth, wind speeds on the order of 450-650 km/hour (280-400 miles/hour) would be required to move pure dust. If dust was mixed with sand, then it would be easier for weaker winds to move the dust particles, by hitting them with sand grains and thus lofting the dust into the air. <br/> <br/> Written by: Sara Martinez-Alonso   (28 July 2008) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009119_1735\" title=\"PSP_009119_1735\">   PSP_009119_1735  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008829_1735\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008829_1735</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008829_1735", "id": 450, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_008829_1735.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/450/", "slug": "fuzzy-looking-landscape-near-tharsis-montes", "title": "Fuzzy-Looking Landscape Near Tharsis Montes"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037877_0985\"></div>In Inca City another week has passed, and <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_037877_0985.jpg\">  <strong>   there are a few more fans on the ridge  </strong> </a> .

The Athabasca Valles region includes a vast lava flow, thought to be the youngest on Mars, with even younger outflow channels that were carved by running water. The source of the water is believed to be the Cerberus Fossae valleys to the north, which may have penetrated to an over-pressurized aquifer in the subsurface. <br/> <br/> Nowadays, erosion by gravity, wind, and frost gradually wears down the rims of the outflow channels. In this scene, <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2014/details/cut/ESP_038224_1890-1.jpg\">  <strong>   we see dark materials along the channel rim  </strong> </a> that were probably exposed by this erosion. The dark materials are less red than the surrounding surface and so they appear blue in this enhanced color picture. Viewed close up, the dark materials show ripples that suggest they are made up of mobile sand. It is possible that this sand originated elsewhere and simply collected where we see it today, but the fact that sand is not found elsewhere in the scene suggest to us that it is eroding out of the volcanic layers at the retreating rim of the channel. <br/> <br/> Sand sources are important because mobile sand grains have only a limited lifetime, wearing down and chipping apart each time they impact the surface. Erosion of the volcanic materials in this region may provide sands to replace those that are destroyed.

The northern part of the image also shows a more extensive lava flow deposit that surrounds the impact ejecta of the largest impact crater in the image. <br/> <br/> Which way did the lava flow? It might appear that the lava flowed from the north through the channel into the partially filled crater.

Since lava does not flow uphill, that means the explanation isn't so simple. <br/> <br/> We have seen much evidence for lava flows in this region that flowed to much higher levels than the present surface, then deflated or drained away. That may have happened here: lava flowed from from north to south to fill this crater, but then it drained back to the north, carving this channel. <br/> <br/> The topographic information that we gained from having a stereo pair let us answer a question that we could not have with only a single image.

The polar layered deposits are thick stacks of permanent water ice at each pole, and the South Polar residual cap may be a permanent (although dynamic) layer of carbon dioxide ice. However, at lower latitudes, seasonal frost (mostly carbon dioxide, but some water ice) comes and goes each year. <br/> <br/> Some outliers of water ice are found near the North Polar layered deposits. In many cases these have accumulated significant thickness, as in Louth Crater. In this case, a thin layer of bright frost was visible in a HiRISE image in early summer, covering part of the wall of a crater. However, the thickness was small—there is little visible effect on the topography of the crater. HiRISE monitored this location through the rest of the season and found that the frost remained all summer, so this is a perennial ice patch, although the edges shrank slightly over the summer. <br/> <br/> Carbon dioxide is not stable under summer conditions, so this is likely a patch of water ice. It may be that it is in the early stages of accumulation, or that the equilibrium amount of ice in a small crater relatively far from the pole is thin. <br/> <br/> A still-unexplained feature of this crater is the diffuse dark smudges visible on the crater floor. These resemble “defrosting spots” which are visible on carbon dioxide ice in the early spring, but they occur on frost-free areas and survive throughout the summer. <br/> <br/> Written by: Colin Dundas (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (15 October 2014) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037551_2540\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037551_2540</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037551_2540", "id": 2743, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_037551_2540.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2743/", "slug": "perennial-frost-in-a-crater-on-the-northern-plains", "title": "Perennial Frost in a Crater on the Northern Plains"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_037300_1825\"></div>This image shows a great deal of geologic diversity in a rather small area. <br/> <br/> In the northern section of the image, we see flat terrain that is probably an ancient lava field.

The fossae (Latin plural for a “ditch” or “depression”) are in close proximity and related to the formation of Athabasca Valles, which lies to the west. These rifts are collapse features believed to form by volcanic and tectonic processes. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_039187_1915-1.jpg\">  <strong>   In this composite image  </strong> </a> , we can see that the rift is not continuous, but discontinuous and offset. The offset could be the result of a preexisting subsurface discontinuity, such as a fault. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_039187_1915-2.jpg\">  <strong>   The close-up view of HiRISE infrared color  </strong> </a> shows us a plethora of information about Cerberus Fossae and the great amount of detail that HiRISE captures. The clear view of boulders strewn in shadowed areas of the rift is a testament to the high signal-to-noise capability and high resolution of the HiRISE camera; aeolian dunes along with boulders deposited from erosion of the rift walls are also visible in detail. <br/> <br/> Using the pixel-length of the shadow within the rift, the incidence angle of the Sun at the time the image was taken, and some trigonometry, the approximate depth of the various sections of Cerberus Fossae can be estimated. Based on this simple method, an approximate depth is 260 meters. This estimate suggests that the rift is as wide as it is deep. <br/> <br/> Another remarkable aspect of this image is the stark contrasts it captures: light-toned dusty surfaces that surround the rift versus the dark blue basaltic sands and the shadows within the rift. The detail that HiRISE can provide is indeed phenomenal, and as demonstrated here, the infrared color provides additional information. Why, for instance, is the floor of Cerberus Fossae a deep blue, and why is there such a contrast with the orange-grayish Martian surface? It's not water! The volcanic and mafic sand contains unoxidized iron, which appears a deep blue, while the Martian surface is covered by oxidized iron-bearing dust which appears orange-grayish. <br/> <br/> Written by: Kayle Hansen, Livio Tornabene, Eric Pilles, Ryan Hopkins (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (7 January 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_039187_1915\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_039187_1915</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_039187_1915", "id": 2757, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_039187_1915.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2757/", "slug": "the-eastern-portion-of-cerberus-fossae", "title": "The Eastern Portion of Cerberus Fossae"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_039148_1980\"></div>This image shows a new impact crater in Elysium Planitia that was first discovered by the Mars Context Camera (CTX, also onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) which formed between February 2012 and June 2014.

The bottom of the image is near the top of the valley side wall and the top of the image shows the edge of the valley floor. <br/> <br/> Several streamlined landforms are visible on the wall of the valley.

The grooves are locally parallel and are also oriented in the approximate downhill direction. <br/> <br/> These features may have formed from what are called mass wasting processes, fluvial erosion, or possibly erosion from strong winds.

These channels, which emerge from the chaotic region, are separated by elongated hills that coalesce into a single channel before disappearing into the Margaritifer Chaos to the north. Chaotic terrains are thought to be the regions where ground water erupted catastrophically onto the surface, forming highly erosive flows that carved the outflow channels.

The SPLD are composed of layers of water ice mixed with impurities (mostly dust). The most similar terrestrial analog to the SPLD are ice sheets, like those covering most of Greenland and Antarctica. <br/> <br/> The <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004708_1000_cut_b.jpg\">  figure shown here </a> is a cutout of the full observation (1.8 kilometers across, or 1 mile; 1844 x 1078, 6 MB) showing a very interesting and somewhat rare feature: a fault. The fault is the thin, diagonal line that cuts through most of the image, from near the lower left corner to near the upper right corner. On each side of the fault, the layers that cross the fault are slightly off-set from one other; in other words, the layers don't line-up with each other anymore. The relationship between the angles at which the layers and fault are exposed and the movement along the fault is complex, but, in general, the layers on the left side of the fault are slightly lower than those on the right. <br/> <br/> Faults are created when rock (or, in this case, water ice) breaks due to some outside force and rocks (or ice) along either side of that break move in opposite directions. One of the most famous faults on Earth is the San Andreas Fault in California. There is a crack between the floor of the Pacific Ocean, plus a little bit of the California and Mexico coastline, and the rest of North America; the Pacific Ocean floor is moving northward along that crack, but North America is moving southward. Because the two sides are grinding against each other, they sometime stick together and then move again in jerky fashion, much like the way if you try to rub pieces of rough sand paper together. When movement along the fault occurs after a period of sticking together, this creates an earthquake. <br/> <br/> For the case of this fault on Mars, it is unlikely that a \"Marsquake\" occurred when movement happened along this fault, because it is so small (over 1000 times shorter than the San Andreas Fault). This is interesting because faults are rare in the Martian polar layered deposits. The fault may have been created during widespread flow of the SPLD. Some of the stiffer ice could not flow and broke instead. Ice can only flow fast enough to create faults when it is relatively warm. Similarly, if you cool molasses enough, it becomes hard and doesn't flow. But the temperatures on Mars today are probably not warm enough to allow the creation of faults. This is why faults are so rare in the Martian ice. When were temperatures warm enough? This is still a mystery.Written by: Kate Fishbaugh   (15 August 2007) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004708_1000\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004708_1000</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004708_1000", "id": 1506, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1152/PSP_004708_1000.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1506/", "slug": "fault-in-the-south-polar-layered-deposits", "title": "Fault in the South Polar Layered Deposits"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_039240_1730\"></div>The dark dunes in the western Medusae Fossae formation provide some evidence of having a local origin. <br/> <br/> This image shows no large dunes, but many of the dark sand patches cover slopes up to discrete layers.

Because Mars is so much colder, however, the seasonal ice that is deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring (generally analogous to winter time snow on Earth) is carbon dioxide ice. Around the south pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter&amp;emdash;this persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south pole residual cap. <br/> <br/> Relatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by circular, oval, and blob-shaped depressions, forming a pattern called \"swiss cheese\" terrain. The high-standing areas are carbon dioxide ice with thicknesses probably of several meters. The depressions are thought to be caused by the removal of carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). By looking at different sized depressions in an image such as this, and by comparing images of the same place from year to year, the development of \"swiss cheese\" terrain can be observed. <br/> <br/> The sublimation process may begin anywhere as a small depression. Once this small depression is formed, it expands laterally in all directions, creating the rounded depressions we see today. As most depressions seem to have a similar depth and have relatively flat bottoms, there is likely some layer below, possibly of water ice, that cannot be as easily removed by sublimation. Thus, while the south polar residual cap as a whole is present every year, there are certainly annual changes taking place within it. <br/> <br/> Especially apparent and interesting in this image are the strips of material that parallel the edges of many depressions. Often there are two or more concentric strips that are smooth like the surrounding surface, but seem to be lower than the surrounding surface and in places appear to be tilted down towards the center of the depression. Inner strips are sometimes broken up into chunks. It may be that the uppermost smooth layer is a bit more resistant to sublimation than the material just below it&amp;emdash;the quicker removal of the underlying material might cause the stronger upper layer to detach from the surrounding terrain and settle down towards the center of the depression. <br/> <br/> Alternatively, these ringing strips may indicate that many layers are present within the carbon dioxide ice. Another interesting feature is the faint crisscrossing network of ridges on the upper smooth terrain. These may also be complexly involved in the sublimation and deposition of carbon dioxide ice. <br/> <br/> With the high resolution capability of HiRISE, we intend to measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over one or more Mars years. Knowing the amount of carbon dioxide removed can give us an idea of the current atmospheric and climate conditions, and possibly how Mars climate may be changing.

Most of the other circular holes are impact craters. Pit craters form when material collapses into a subsurface void (commonly on volcanoes, such as Kilauea in Hawai'i). Voids may form on volcanoes when parts of the \"plumbing\" system transporting lava are drained, or when extension and stretching of the volcano causes gaps below the surface. <br/> <br/> Pit craters may resemble impact craters. However, there is evidence that the two large depressions in this image are pit craters. Impact craters as large and deep as these would likely have a raised rim of material ejected during its formation.  Erosion of the rim would partially fill the crater, but these are relatively deep despite having no raised rim. Additionally, these pits are roughly aligned with other depressions outside the image, a likely arrangement for pit craters. <br/> <br/> Layers exposed around the edges of these craters are likely old lava flows which covered the surface of the region, breaking up into boulders.

It is possible that the plains are eroding and exposing (exhuming) craters that formed long ago and were since buried. A crater that is being uncovered can look like a faint ring, of which many examples are visible here.  The edge of the plains is marked by a cliff located approximately halfway down the image. This cliff is the wall of a valley that might have once flowed into the enclosed trough, Ophir Cavus, located directly south of it. <br/> <br/> Ophir Cavus is seen to have landslides on both of its walls. It contains dunes and what appears to be a coherent mass of material on its floor that is probably eroding. It also has a series of layers around its rim. These layers probably continue under the surrounding plains. <br/> <br/> South of Ophir Cavus, located at the bottom of the image, are plains that have a much different appearance from the plains at the top. These plains have a few craters that might be exhumed, but also several fresher ones. The fresher craters have darker bottoms, implying that the depth to which these craters disturbed the surface corresponds with a darker layer. Some of the dark-bottomed craters have faint dark rays that have not been blown away by the wind; this also verifies that they are relatively recently formed. <br/> <br/> The floor of the valley also has a large number of craters, many of which are small. The majority of these craters have a bright tail pointing in the southwest direction ( <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005082_1700_cut_b.jpg\">  see subimage, </a> approximately 950 meters across; 1928 x 1346; 7 MB). This indicates that the wind was probably blowing from the northeast when these craters formed. Since wind directions change frequently on Mars, it is possible that a large number of the valleys craters formed at the same time. This suggests that they are secondary craters: craters that form when material thrown out from a bigger impact is moving fast enough to create these craters. Secondary craters commonly form in clumps, also seen in the subimage. <br/> <br/> Please note that the vertical stripes seen in the image are camera artifacts.

This far south, the surface material is likely to be ice-rich and will slowly flow downhill. Additional evidence for near-surface ice is provided by the pervasive polygons in the image, forming due to stresses caused by temperature variations in ice-rich ground. <br/> <br/> Regardless of the mechanism, the crater remains faintly expressed in the surface morphology. Note that the surface has a similar texture away from the crater, but not organized into concentric arcs.

This image also addresses several objectives besides keeping track of the rover location, such as the monitoring of nearby active sand dunes and the degree to which rover tracks are preserved on the underlying terrain. Unlike other regions of for which Curiosity has traversed, here the rover tracks are not apparent, likely because the disturbed, underlying, dark sand is similar in tone to that on the surface.

Layers appear offset from one side of the fault to another indicating that the layered deposits have been fractured into large blocks that have moved relative to each other.

Another less obvious fault lies near the center of the image at the base of the scarp. This fault does not break through, or even deform, the upper layers which may indicate that the fault occurred when only half the layered deposits had accumulated.

Seeing layering is always exciting to geologists because it implies that the region has experienced multiple climatic conditions or geologic processes through time. The study of layering is so important in geology that it has its own dedicated branch of study: stratigraphy! <br/> <br/> Commonly, layering implies different lithologies (i.e., rock types). However, sometimes the layers could be of very similar composition but formed in different periods of time. This could happen for example in the case of annual flood deposits from rivers, multiple volcanic eruptions, or annual or periodic deposition of ice-rich material. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_040258_1215-1.jpg\">  <strong>   We can also see in this image another feature called terracing  </strong> </a> , which happens when the layers form distinctive planes on top of one another like terraces. This could imply that the layers are being eroded with time but some of the layers are being eroded quicker than others because they are less resistant to erosion. <br/> <br/> So what is the composition of these layers? Spallanzani Crater lies in the high latitudes of the Southern hemisphere (around 60 degrees in latitude) so there is a good possibility that the deposits are ice-rich. <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_040258_1215-2.jpg\">  <strong>   If we look more closely  </strong> </a> we will notice fractured mounds, which sometimes indicate the presence of subsurface ice. Another interesting observation is the presence of grooves in the shaded slopes of some of the layers. Perhaps these grooves formed because of the sublimation (the direct transfer of solid ice to water vapor) of ice from these slopes since slopes tend to get warmer than the surrounding terrains. <br/> <br/> A close inspection of this image may help answer this question and investigate the multiple cycles in which these deposits were laid down as well as the duration of these individual cycles. <br/> <br/> Written by: M.

The variations in the relative amounts of ice and dust are probably caused by recent climate changes on Mars, similar to ice ages on Earth. <br/> <br/> This image of the south polar layered deposits shows many layers, some of which are cut off or truncated against other layers (near the center of the image). These truncations are probably due to periods of erosion separating periods of deposition. <br/> <br/> After nearly horizontal layers are deposited, they can be partly eroded (perhaps by winds) before more layers are deposited over them. In this image, there is evidence for at least two such episodes of erosion and burial. These types of observations are useful to Mars scientists as they try to unravel the climate history of Mars.Written by: Ken Herkenhoff   (18 September 2007) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004742_0990\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004742_0990</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004742_0990", "id": 1546, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1152/PSP_004742_0990.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1546/", "slug": "geologic-history-recorded-in-the-south-polar-layer", "title": "Geologic History Recorded in the South Polar Layered Deposits"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005149_1715\"></div>Light-toned layering can be seen throughout this image taken along the plains south of Ius Chasma in Valles Marineris. <br/> <br/> A portion of one of the troughs of Ius Chasma is visible in the lower right of the image. The layering is exposed where a meters-thick darker unit has been eroded away, suggesting the light-toned layered deposit is more extensive in area than what is visible by exposures along the plains. <br/> <br/> The layering could have formed by several processes, including aeolian (wind-blown), fluvial (water-lain), and volcanism. If aeolian, then the material must be located elsewhere on Mars where it was eroded and then subsequently deposited by the wind here along the plains. A fluvial origin implies there was water activity that deposited the light-toned material, although there is no evidence for fluvial activity at this location. Explosive volcanism is a likely process that would have occurred in association with the emplacement of the darker lava flows that make up the plains. <br/> <br/> The morphology of the light-toned layering is unlike that seen within Valles Marineris and indicates different processes operated along the plains compared to those that emplaced the deposits within the troughs.Written by: Cathy   (19 September 2007) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005215_1715\" title=\"PSP_005215_1715\">   PSP_005215_1715  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005149_1715\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005149_1715</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005149_1715", "id": 1547, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1152/PSP_005149_1715.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1547/", "slug": "light-toned-layering-along-plains-south-of-ius-cha", "title": "Light-Toned Layering along Plains South of Ius Chasma"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004673_0935\"></div>Like Earth, Mars has concentrations of water ice at both poles.

The book describes Acidalia as flat and easy to drive over; he even drives to the Pathfinder landing site and back. <br/> <br/> This region of Mars is actually <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_026086_2115.jpg\">  <strong>   far more diverse, interesting, and hazardous  </strong> </a> to drive over than depicted in the novel.

There are also fissures associated with giant polygons, with steep rocky slopes that would be impassable. There are elongated fields of dense secondary craters where the surface is extremely rough at scales near the size of the rover. When our hero travels into Arabia Terra it is described as much rockier than Acidalia, but the opposite is generally true: much of Arabia is dust mantled and smooth at the scale of a rover. <br/> <br/> People commonly  assume that smooth at large scales (kilometers) means smooth at small scales (meters to tens of meters). Often on Mars, the exact opposite is seen: large flat low areas are more wind-scoured, removing fine materials and leaving rocks and eroded bedrock. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen (audio: Phil Plait)   (11 March 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_026086_2115\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_026086_2115</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_026086_2115", "id": 2806, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_026086_2115.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2806/", "slug": "ares-3-and-the-martian", "title": "Ares 3 and The Martian"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_039955_1875\"></div>One of the major extended-mission objectives for HiRISE has been to re-image parts of the surface to look for changes.

Dry ice, which is thought to cause flows in some gullies and the North polar dunes, does not occur this close to the equator. There is no sign of recurring slope lineae, the leading candidates for liquid on the Martian surface. Instead, it is most likely that these were dry flows.

Hypotheses include melting of snow or near-surface ground ice. <br/> <br/> Other features also suggest the past (and possibly present) presence of snow or ground ice in this region. For example, the “mantle” deposit on the crater wall displays polygonal fractures. Polygons on Earth are associated with periglacial activity. This refers to processes that occur from the presence of ground ice, which interacts with surface and subsurface materials, as well as the Martian atmosphere as a function of climate and seasons). The mantle itself may be the remains of a dusty snowpack deposited in Mars’ recent past. <br/> <br/> At the base of the mantle are fractures associated with the slumping of these deposits under their own weight and Martian gravity. The largest gullies cut into these mantling deposits, and in some places obscure the underlying fractures at the base of the crater wall.

One of the many discoveries from this mission is that there are seasonal flows on some steep slopes, that have a set of characteristics consistent with shallow seeps of salty water. They are called recurring slope lineae because they fade and disappear during cold seasons and reappear in warm seasons, repeating this pattern every Martian year. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_042228_1670.jpg\">  <strong>   The flows in this image  </strong> </a> , in a part of Coprates Chasma, are on a north-facing slope so they are active now, in northern spring. The flows emanate from the relatively bright bedrock and flow onto sandy fans, where they are remarkably straight, following linear channels. Valles Marineris contains more of these flows than everywhere else on Mars combined, and they are always active although on changing slope aspects with season. Future human explorers (and settlers?) will need water to drink, grow food, produce oxygen to breathe, and to produce rocket fuel.  Bringing all of that water from Earth would be extremely expensive, so using water on Mars is essential. <br/> <br/> Although there is plenty of water ice at high latitudes, surviving the cold winters would be difficult.

In this case, and given the proximity of the Apollonaris Patera volcanic center, we think that these wind-carved deposits are comprised of volcanic ash and pyroclastics that erupted from Apollonaris when it was last active in the not-too-distant geologic past. <br/> <br/> Over time, the softer materials (likely volcanic ash) were eroded away, leaving behind the harder materials in the form of elongated ridges that are parallel to the direction of the prevailing wind. The end result is a stunning, out-of-this-world display of yardangs, sculpted with the artistic chisel of the Martian wind. <br/> Written by: Elizabeth Silber, Livio Tornabene, and Kayle Hansen   (12 August 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_041929_1675\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_041929_1675</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_041929_1675", "id": 2836, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_041929_1675.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2836/", "slug": "yardang-sculpted-deposits-from-apollonaris-patera", "title": "Yardang-Sculpted Deposits from Apollonaris Patera"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042014_1760\"></div>We previously released stereo images of the Ares 3 landing site from Andy Weir’s “The Martian.”  In the novel, stranded astronaut Mark Watney travels from the Ares 3 site to the Ares 4 site where a Mars Ascent Vehicle could get him into Mars orbit to rejoin a spacecraft and return home. <br/> <br/> The Ares 4 site is on the floor of a very shallow crater in the southwestern corner of Schiaparelli Crater. Our image image shows a flat region that is entirely mantled by bright Martian dust.

No boulders are visible, so the dust is probably at least a meter thick. <br/> <br/> Past Martian rovers and landers from NASA have avoided such pervasively dust-covered regions for two reasons.  First, the dust has a low thermal inertia, meaning that it gets extra warm in the daytime and extra cold at night, a thermal challenge to survival of the landers and rovers (and people).  Second, the dust hides the bedrock, so little is known about the bedrock composition and whether it is of scientific interest. <br/> <br/> There is morphologic evidence for layered rocks, and narrow curving structures that could be fluvial channels, so the bedrock geology could be quite interesting, but exploring this site would be like trying to do field work when there is several feet of snow on the ground.  Then again, maybe the dust is cemented so it is easier to drive or walk on it, but it still hides the bedrock from easy access. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen   (30 September 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042014_1760\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042014_1760</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042014_1760", "id": 2848, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_042014_1760.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2848/", "slug": "from-ares-3-to-ares-4", "title": "From Ares 3 to Ares 4"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_041277_2115\"></div>Andy Weir, the author of the best-selling novel “The Martian,” had previously contacted the HiRISE team requesting that we take a picture of the Ares 3 landing site from his novel in Acidalia Planitia, within driving distance from the Pathfinder lander and Sojourner rover. <br/> <br/> One of the main objectives of the HiRISE camera is to carry out “monitoring science”, which means we usually take images of certain areas of high scientific interest on regular intervals. We usually do so to monitor a seasonal or recurring process such as <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_040566_0935\">  <strong>   melting of ice  </strong> </a> in spring in the polar regions, <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_020782_1610\">  <strong>   dune monitoring  </strong> </a> , or <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_040590_1335\">  <strong>   recurring slope lineae  </strong> </a> . However, we also take multiple images to keep “checking up” on the progress of <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/releases/msl-images.php\">  <strong>   active rovers such as Curiosity  </strong> </a> to make sure it’s in good shape, and in order to help plan a safe, future route that would also place it within striking distance of areas of high scientific interest. <br/> <br/> There is another key responsibility for the HiRISE camera, which is to help choose landing sites for future missions. One of the techniques we usually use is to image a certain site of interest at least twice when the weather conditions are similar, but with a small difference in viewing angle, much like what you would experience if you looked at something with only your right eye, then looked at it again with the left. By doing this, we are able to build a <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_041277_2115-1.jpg\">  <strong>   “stereo view”  </strong> </a> of the site, providing a chance to identify high and low points in the site more effectively. Another useful technique is to combine these two images using elevation data from laser altimeters to <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/dtm/dtm.php?ID=ESP_023531_1840\">  <strong>   create a highly accurate “digital terrain model”  </strong> </a> or DTM for short. <br/> <br/> DTMs allow us to view the locations in 3D and to analyze them by measuring the exact height of features that could be hazardous to the future mission such as large boulders or small impact craters. DTMs from HiRISE were a key factor in choosing the landing site for Curiosity in Gale Crater and are extensively being used as well to choose sites for the 2016 InSight lander and Mars 2020 rover missions. And now, we have a similar stereo pair for the Ares 3 landing site. That way, NASA can start planning on sending Mark Watney to Mars! <br/> <br/> Written by: M.

These streaks are long, thin dark-toned features. They appear when the superficial light-tone fine-grained materials (i.e., Martian dust) suddenly move down slope and expose the darker underlying volcanic surfaces. Repeat imaging shows that dust streaks are consistently dark when they are initially formed and become lighter over time. This is due to the steady deposition of dust from the atmosphere. Slope streaks are also visible along the slopes of ridges and shallow depressions. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_041901_2065-2.jpg\">  <strong>   Two ridges here exhibit partially exposed bedrock  </strong> </a> . These outcrops are interpreted to still have abundant coatings and dust, obscuring the underlying bedrock. This interpretation is based on the lack of bluish color for volcanic bedrock from the infrared-red-blue swath of our camera, and consistent with the homogenous tannish color we see throughout the same swath. It’s possible that the ridges here and throughout the Lycus Sulci region formed via volcanic and tectonic processes, which have been further sculpted by wind erosion and other mass wasting processes. For example, talus slopes, which appear as fine-grained fans or conical-shaped deposits, originate from the steepest portions of the ridges. These form when the rocks or deposits on the steepest slopes of a ridge fail under the influence of Martian gravity and their own mass, causing an avalanche of these materials, which then accumulate downslope. <br/> <br/> Written by: Kayle Hansen, Livio Tornabene, and Elizabeth Silber   (12 August 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_041901_2065\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_041901_2065</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_041901_2065", "id": 2837, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_041901_2065.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2837/", "slug": "ridge-and-talus-in-lycus-sulci", "title": "Ridge and Talus in Lycus Sulci"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_024497_1745\"></div>This image shows numerous branching ridges with various degrees of sinuosity.

The bigger one (on the right) is about 100 meters in diameter and is shaped like a doughnut with a hole in the middle. Its smaller companion is more compact and plume-like, but it too has a small hole in the center, where the air pressure is lowest. It may be that the smaller dust devil is younger than the larger one. A row of four dust devils are in the middle of the color strip, separated by about 900 meters from one another. <br/> <br/> This image might answer some interesting questions about the behavior of dust devils. Dust devils are theoretically expected to migrate uphill on a sloping surface, or migrate downwind when there is a breeze. Where they are found close together in pairs, they are expected to rotate in opposite directions. HiRISE color observations can be used to determine the direction of rotation and—for fast moving dust devils—the direction of their travel. This is because the different color observations (infrared, red, and blue) are taken at slightly different times. The differences between the earliest color observation and the last tell us about the changes that took place during that time interval. <br/> <br/> All this requires careful analysis, but if these dust devils are moving fast enough, and spaced closely enough, these here might display some interesting “social dynamics,” possibly marching together and rotating in alternating directions. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler   (4 November 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042201_1715\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042201_1715</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042201_1715", "id": 2856, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_042201_1715.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2856/", "slug": "marching-dust-devils", "title": "Marching Dust Devils"}, {"content": "<a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/details/cut/PSP_010862_1880_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   This impact crater  </strong> </a> is only about 5.5 meters (18 feet) across - tiny compared to the giant basins that scar most planetary bodies. This type of bowl-shaped crater is called a simple crater. It's “simple” compared to larger craters that have terraces, central peaks and rings, and other, more complex, shapes. <br/> <br/> Why should we care about such a small, plain crater? One reason is that it's extremely young. The large craters we see on Mars are millions to several billion years old, but this crater formed between January 2006 and May 2008. That means it was only a few months to a few years old when HiRISE observed it. We know this because we have been studying Mars with multiple missions over a long time period, and we can compare images of the same area and detect changes. In this case, the <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/index.html\">  <strong>   Context camera  </strong> </a> on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took an image that had a dark spot in it. (To see the dark spot in the CTX image, look near the middle of <a href=\"http://viewer.mars.asu.edu/planetview/inst/ctx/P19_008515_1880_XI_08N192W#start\">  <strong>   this image  </strong> </a> , to the left of the central group of little hills.)  When this was compared to <a href=\"http://viewer.mars.asu.edu/planetview/inst/themis#/planetview/inst/themis/V18092020\">  <strong>   a previous image from the THEMIS instrument  </strong> </a> , the dark spot wasn't there. Therefore, we know it must have formed between the dates those two images were taken. <br/> <br/> The Context camera has a lower resolution than HiRISE, in order to cover more area. A single pixel is about the same size as this crater. So that Context image can't resolve the crater; all that's visible is a dark spot. When HiRISE followed up on the detection and returned this more detailed image, we could see that the dark spot is actually a much larger area surrounding this tiny crater. The dark area that allows us to detect these new impacts is probably the result of lighter-colored dust being blown off the surface by the impact event. <br/> <br/> At this site, there are also some streaks of dark material that was ejected out of the ground. Using this higher resolution image, we can positively identify a new crater at the center of the dark spot. <br/> <br/> Written by: Ingrid Daubar   (16 December 2009) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010862_1880\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010862_1880</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010862_1880", "id": 586, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_010862_1880.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/586/", "slug": "new-impact-crater-formed-between-jan-2006-and-may-", "title": "New Impact Crater: Formed between Jan 2006 and May 2008"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042124_1665\"></div>These strange features in Syria Planum are still being widely debated. They have the same general form as transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) elsewhere on Mars; windblown deposits that are common in the Martian tropics. Their height and spacing are similar to the more familiar looking TARs in other places, and they are similarly bright. Unless Nature is perverse, they were both made by the same process. <br/> <br/> Yet the TARs here in Syria Planum appear different than typical TARs elsewhere on the planet. They have blunt edges, in contrast to the tapering ends of typical TARs. The ridge crests are serrated, unlike the smooth crests of most TARs.  They are layered on their upwind faces and scoured on the downwind sides, whereas TARs are usually smooth and symmetric. Why are these TARs bizarre? <br/> <br/> A possible answer is that the features here in Syria Planum are at a different stage of evolution than TARs elsewhere, and are either younger or older than typical TARs. <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_042124_1665.jpg\">  <strong>   We can look at an enhanced color cutout  </strong> </a> to see whether this can be the case. <br/> <br/> Our cutout covers the width of the color strip (1 kilometer) and is centered on a bare patch in a field of bright TARs. The illumination direction is from the top left, and the wind direction is from top to bottom. At first glance, these TARs look like they could be old, degraded versions of the TARs with which we are familiar. However, erosion tends to smooth things out and not create sharp edges where none existed previously. More likely, we are seeing TARs in the process of formation. The distinctive features of the TARs in Syria Planum — the blunt edges, serrated ridges, and the asymmetric appearance of the surface — are features that are more easily removed than created by erosion. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler   (16 September 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042124_1665\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042124_1665</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042124_1665", "id": 2839, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_042124_1665.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2839/", "slug": "bizarre-tars", "title": "Bizarre TARs"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042040_1275\"></div>The workings of the Martian winds are visible in this image of sand dunes trapped inside an unnamed crater in southern Terra Cimmeria. <br/> <br/> Many of the craters in the Southern highlands of Mars contain sand dunes, and HiRISE is still in the process of mapping these dunes and determining how active they are today. So far, the dunes in these craters appear to be a mixed bunch, with some dunes actively advancing while others seem to be frozen in place. This image will be compared <a class=\"caption\" href-=\"http://uahirise.org/PSP_006859_1275\">  <strong>   to a previous picture  </strong> </a> , to see how these dunes have changed since 2008. <br/> <br/> The sand dunes are the large, branched ridges and dark patches that are conspicuous against the bright background, particularly in the northwest corner of our picture. There are also signs of two other wind-related processes: smaller, brighter ridges line the floor of the crater in regularly spaced rows. These are also windblown deposits, mysterious “transverse aeolian ridges” or TARs that are more common in the Martian tropics. Faint, irregular dark lines cross the dunes and the TARs, marking the tracks of dust devils that vacuum the surface during southern summer. So, which came first? We can untangle the history of these processes by looking at the picture more closely. <br/> <br/> Over most of the image, it is obvious that the dark sand dunes bury the bright TARs, meaning that the sand dunes are younger than the TARs. But this relationship is not so clear for the southernmost dune <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2015/details/cut/ESP_042040_1275.jpg\">  <strong>   we see in this picture  </strong> </a> . Here, the TARs look like they extend into the dune and merge with ripples on the dune’s surface, suggesting that the TARs might be younger than the dunes. The question can be resolved by carefully examining an enhanced color cutout. The TARs are brighter and redder than the sand dunes and this color persists on the crests of the TARs as the sand encroaches, burying the valleys first and then the slopes and finally the TAR crests. This tells us that the unusual appearance of the dune margin is caused by burial and exposure of the older TARs by the younger sand. Finally, you can trace the tracks of dust devils crossing over the dunes, telling us that they are younger than the dunes. <br/> <br/> So, first came the TARs, next the dunes, and last the dust devils — probably within the last few months! <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler   (16 September 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042040_1275\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042040_1275</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042040_1275", "id": 2840, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_042040_1275.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2840/", "slug": "which-came-first", "title": "Which Came First?"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_041893_1975\"></div>A variety of diverse morphological features are present in this image (21 by 5.5 kilometers) located in the southeastern area of the Nili Fossae region and just northeast of Syrtis Major. <br/> <br/> This particular region has been studied intensely due to the presence of volcanics from Syrtis Major and impact ejecta from the Isidis Basin. The region is rich in unaltered mafic deposits, in contact with diverse altered deposits rich in clays, carbonates, and sulfates. These deposits make the Nili Fossae region one of the most colorful regions on Mars, which is most distinctive in infrared color composites (IRB).

A mesa is a flat, steep-sloped hill, which was likely eroded by a combination of wind-driven and landslide processes. These are often formed due to differing rock compositions, which vary in their resistance to erosion, e.g., a weaker and softer rock, such as sediments, lies beneath a stronger and more resistant rock. The flat top surfaces of mesas, termed the “cap” rock, are relatively erosion-resistant rock types, such as igneous lavas or intrusive sills.

They are deep holes that may lead to underground caves in volcanic terrain. This isolated pit crater is located in a lava field that is crisscrossed by long, linear troughs. <br/> <br/> A commonly invoked hypothesis to explain these troughs is that they are collapsed lava tubes, essentially tunnels formed by underground rivers of lava. Lava tube collapse may begin with the buckling of its roof at one location where the roof is thinnest. At this point, light enters into the permanent darkness of the cave from above, forming a skylight. Pits or skylights are distinct from impact craters: they appear as dark, roughly circular shadowed holes because of their steep walls, while the shadows cast by impact craters generally shade only a portion of the crater floor, because the slopes of the walls are shallower. When this picture was taken, sunlight directly lit part of the floor of this pit crater, illuminating the large boulders (see close up image) on its southeastern slope. <br/> <br/> The first skylights were discovered in 2007 on Mars, and in 2009 on the Moon. The famous Devil’s Throat is Hawaii is a good Earth-example: it’s 50 meters wide and accessible by foot.

The craters themselves may be the result of secondary impacts, craters caused by debris from a distant larger impact. Since then, the surface has been significantly modified and reworked, muting the craters and flattening their floors. <br/> <br/> Presently, there are a few sand dunes and a broad overlay of a dusty soil mantle. This soil mantle occurs over much of the middle latitudes of Mars. Here, as elsewhere, the mantle covers these craters, but a closer inspection reveals that its smooth texture becomes significantly pitted and bumpy on the pole facing slopes of each crater interior wall. <br/> <br/> It has been hypothesized that this pitting of the mantle is the result of the evaporation of shallow ice.  As subsurface ice is lost, the removal of this bonding ice cement allows soil grains to be eroded by the wind. Then the resulting deflation of the soil forms the observed pitted textures. Alternatively, the loss of relatively pure underground ice deposits would cause a reduction of the surface soil and collapse to form the same textures. <br/> <br/> Written by: Mike Mellon (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (23 December 2015) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042886_1480\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042886_1480</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042886_1480", "id": 2868, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_042886_1480.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2868/", "slug": "icy-erosion", "title": "Icy Erosion"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_042806_1785\"></div>In March 2016, the European Space Agency in partnership with Roscosmos will launch the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.

Exactly how these channels formed—by rainfall, snowmelt, or seepage from underground springs—is often debated. <br/> <br/> The answer has important ramifications about the early Martian climate. Clues about the source of the water may indicate the shape, layout, and scale of the various tributaries in a channel system. <br/> <br/> Our image shows an example of just such a water-carved channel.  The channel pattern, called “dendritic” because of its tree–like branching, begins at the top of the image and runs down over the rim of an ancient impact basin across the basin floor. <br/> <br/> The soil surface overlying these channels, and indeed the entire landscape, has been changed and reworked over the intervening millions of years, by the combined actions of wind and ice.

However, the fine dust in the Martian atmosphere scatters light into the shadows, and HiRISE has the sensitivity to acquire useful images within shadows. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_044327_1375.jpg\">  <strong>   The bluish areas are covered by seasonal carbon dioxide frost  </strong> </a> .

When this gas escapes it fluidizes loose rocky materials on these steep slopes forming debris flows. <br/> <br/> Initially this was considered a type of secondary activity, but we now realize that this activity can fully explain the formation of the fresh-looking gullies on Mars.

(For an appreciation of the dimensions of this crater, <a href=\"http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/ANAGLYPH/PSP/ORB_002100_002199/PSP_002118_1510_PSP_003608_1510/PSP_002118_1510_PSP_003608_1510_RED.browse.png\">  <strong>   see the anaglyph for Zumba.  </strong> </a> ) Zumba is approximately 25 percent deeper than the average Martian crater of this size -- just one of several attributes that suggests it is a very fresh crater. <br/> <br/> One estimate of Zumba's age, generally accomplished by counting smaller superimposed craters on Zumba itself, suggests it may be 5 million years young. Even if such an estimate is off by 2-4 times, this is still a young geologic feature by Mars standards. Because Zumba is so young and so fresh, it is a perfect example of a simple crater.  On Mars, a simple crater is generally less than 6-9 km (about 3.7-5.6 mi) in diameter with a âsimpleâ conical-bowl shape, minimal wall collapse, and lacking a well-developed central feature (e.g., a peak, large pit, or ring). <br/> <br/> By impacting into such hard durable rocks, the impact that created Zumba scattered greater than 10 million ejecta blocks at high speeds resulting in far-reaching ray segments and an impressive field of secondary impact craters ( <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/details/cut/PSP_003608_1510_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   see the subimage  </strong> </a> ). This pattern is hard to see in visible-light images, but âlights-upâ spectacularly in nighttime thermal infrared images taken by THEMIS onboard the Mars Odyssey 2001 Orbiter ( <a href=\"http://themis.asu.edu/features/gratteri\">  <strong>   see Gratteri Crater's Far-Flung Rays  </strong> </a> ). Scientists believe that some of these high-speed rocks may have even been expelled from Mars and even traveled to Earth (see <a href=\"http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Jan07/MarsRayedCraters.html\">  <strong>   Did Martian Meteorites Come From These Sources?  </strong> </a> ). <br/> <br/> Zumba is of considerable interest to scientists, whether it's a source of Martian meteorites or not, as it possesses interesting features that are typically buried or eroded away in other older Martian craters, and even within the freshest terrestrial craters (including Meteor crater in Arizona; see Meteor crater in Google Earth: <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/details/cut/Meteor_crater.kmz\">  <strong>   Meteor crater.kmz  </strong> </a> ). These preserved and newly recognized features observed at the scale of HiRISE may reveal aspects of the impact process unknown to scientists from previous studies of craters on the terrestrial planets. <br/> <br/> What is particularly intriguing is the presence of a pitted deposit giving Zumba the appearance that it has a relatively flat floor despite the pits. These crater-fill deposits are typically composed of lightly to highly damaged rock fragments and impact melts formed from the high temperatures achieved from the energy released by the impact event (i.e., on the order several to tens of megatons). The pits in the crater-fill deposits have not been recognized within lunar or terrestrial craters and appear to be unique to crater-fill deposits in only the freshest and best-preserved Martian craters. <br/> <br/> These pits may represent the result of the interactions of the very hot crater-fill deposits with water and water-ice that may have been present in the subsurface prior to impact. It is not well understood whether these pits form explosively (similar to terrestrial volcanic pits/craters formed from the interaction of hot lava with wet sediments/deposits), or by collapse from the drainage of impact melts or volatiles. The presence of pitted deposits in only the freshest and well-preserved craters suggests that they are likely related to the impact process. <br/> Written by: Livio L.

To make things more difficult, the gullies are on a steep slope facing away from the sun, so they are in deep shadow. Under these conditions, HiRISE takes what are called “bin 4” images. This means that the image shows less detail, but by adding up the light from 16 pixels (a 4x4 square) we can see details in shadows. <br/> <br/> Even with the reduced resolution, we can see plenty of detail in the gullies, and learn about the seasonal frost. <br/> <br/> Written by: Colin Dundas (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (9 March 2016) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044709_1275\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044709_1275</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044709_1275", "id": 2885, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_044709_1275.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2885/", "slug": "night-vision", "title": "Night Vision"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044258_1715\"></div>This image is at the eastern edge of a very large deposit of wind-blown dust that occupies Ganges Chasma. <br/> <br/> This thick deposit surrounds hills and mesas that rise up through it.

On Mars, such processes might be related to the giant outflow flood channels, which deposited sediment on the plains. <br/> <br/> Written by: Colin Dundas (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (20 April 2016) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044745_2210\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044745_2210</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044745_2210", "id": 2897, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_044745_2210.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2897/", "slug": "cratered-cones-in-acidalia-planitia", "title": "Cratered Cones in Acidalia Planitia"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044662_2010\"></div>The Nili Fossae region, located on the northwest rim of Isidis impact basin, is one of the most colorful regions of Mars. <br/> <br/> The colors over many regions of Mars are homogenized by the dust and regolith, but here the bedrock is very well exposed, except where there are sand dunes.

This could be a sign of recent activity where material has moved downhill. <br/> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/images/2009/details/cut/ESP_013948_1410_cut2.jpg\">  <strong>   Yet another site  </strong> </a> nearby within the same crater has multiple overlapping gullies of different types. Most of these have large fan-shaped deposits at the bottom, and a few to the left side of the subimage have bright deposits where new material may have been deposited or exposed. Some of the channels and fans contain ripples; this might be where wind eroded loose material, or it may be a texture that formed as sand or liquid moved down the slope. Some of the gully-like features in this image are more likely dry landslide chutes. <br/> <br/> This is also a good example of how we use lower-resolution data from other missions, like this <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/e07_e12/images/E11/E1101445.html\">  <strong>   previous MOC image  </strong> </a> , to target the HiRISE camera.

Although earlier pictures are generally sufficient for mapping the terrain and topography, new images allow scientists and engineers to study rover tracks and their covering with dust over time. <br/> <br/> The ability to keep track of the rovers' progress  and seeing their current location on Mars in the HiRISE images is of great interest to the public. In the case of Curiosity, new images allow the tracking of active sand dunes currently in the vicinity of the rover.

This sort of tectonic stretching creates faults in the crust (cracks along with masses of rock slide.

Another investigation of this area (Balme et al., 2011) discovered a repeat pattern of dune-like forms in the channel interpreted as fluvial dunes (or, giant current ripples) which are dunes formed by  flowing water. <br/> <br/> This is one of only a few places on Mars where these pristine-appearing landforms have been identified. The channel formed by catastrophic floods, during which it produced the prominent crater-cored, teardroped-shaped island in the middle. The island has the blunter end pointing upstream and the long tail pointing downstream. <br/> <br/> Both the island and the fluvial dunes were formed by these extreme floods and their size is an indicator of the enormous discharges required to create them. The  margins of  the channel also show the terminal front of a pristine lava flow unit that inundated the channel from the south and the dunes show the remnants of another older lava flow. The top of the island displays polygonal patterned ground texture, which is a characteristic of periglacial processes in ice-rich ground. <br/> <br/> The dark materials from the channel and island walls are probably dark sand being eroded from an underlying horizontal basaltic (lava) layer. The crater at the core of the island has elongated dunes and reticulate dust ridges inside. This single image thus contains features formed by periglacial, volcanic, fluvial, impact, aeolian and mass wasting processes, all in one place. <br/> <br/> Written by: Henrik Hargitai and Ginny Gulick (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (8 September 2016) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_044989_1845\" title=\"ESP_044989_1845\">   ESP_044989_1845  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_045833_1845\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_045833_1845</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_045833_1845", "id": 2929, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_045833_1845.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2929/", "slug": "a-streamlined-form-in-lethe-vallis", "title": "A Streamlined Form in Lethe Vallis"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_045614_1330\"></div>Kaiser Crater hosts a large field of sand dunes.

As a result, the dunes here form distinct dots and dashes.  The “dashes” are linear dunes formed by bi-directional winds, which are not traveling parallel to the dune. Instead, the combined effect of winds from two directions at right angles to the dunes, funnels material into a linear shape. The smaller “dots” (called “barchanoid dunes”) occur where there is some interruption to the process forming those linear dunes.

In many cases, sediment from this activity is trapped in low-lying areas, such as craters. Aeolian features in the form of dunes and ripples can occur in many places on Mars depending upon regional wind regimes. <br/> <br/> The Cerberus Fossae are a series of discontinuous fissures along dusty plains in the southeastern region of Elysium Planitia. This rift zone is thought to be the result of combined volcano-tectonic processes. Dark sediment has accumulated in areas along the floor of these fissures as well as inactive ripple-like aeolian bedforms known as “transverse aeolian ridges” (TAR). <br/> <br/> Viewed through HiRISE infrared color, the basaltic sand lining the fissures’ floor stands out as deep blue against the light-toned dust covering the region. This, along with the linearity of the fissures and the wave like appearance of the TAR, give the viewer an impression of a river cutting through the Martian plains.

However, while Earth’s axial tilt (also known as “obliquity”) tends to change very slightly over time (almost 3 degrees in 40,000 year-cycles), the obliquity of Mars is much more chaotic and varies widely from 0 to almost 60 degrees! The fact that it is currently similar to that of the Earth is merely a coincidence. <br/> <br/> Currently, water-ice is stable on the Martian surface only in the polar regions. However, during times of “high obliquity,” that stability shifts towards the equatorial regions. We see evidence for recent periods of high obliquity on Mars in the form of features common in the mid-latitude regions, which planetary scientists call “viscous flow features,” “lobate debris aprons,” or “lineated valley fills.” These are all scientifically conservative ways of describing features on Mars that resemble mountain glaciers on Earth. <br/> <br/> We now know from radar observations, particularly using the SHARAD instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, that these features are really composed of mixtures of pure ice and dust, and as a result, many scientists have started using the term “glacier-like forms” (GLF) to describe some of them. The main reason that these feature are still present for us to observe nowadays—despite the inhospitable conditions for water ice in these latitudes—is that these “glaciers” are covered by thin layers of dust, which protect them from the atmosphere of Mars and prevents, or significantly slows down, the loss of ice through sublimation to the atmosphere. <br/> <br/> However, if we were to take a look at this image of a “lobate debris apron,” we will see that some areas show numerous depressions, which suggests that these areas have lost some of the ice creating these “deflation features.” In addition, <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_046039_2295.jpg\">  <strong>   if we zoom in on one of these depressions  </strong> </a> , we will see surface polygonal patterns, which are common in cold regions on Earth (such as Alaska, northern Canada, and Siberia) and are indicators of shallow sub-surface water-ice. <br/> <br/> Written by: M.

Both the caldera and the crater are degraded by aeolian (wind) erosion. The strong prevailing winds have apparently carved deep grooves into the terrain. <br/> <br/> When looking at the scene for the first time, the image seems motion blurred. <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_045777_1765.jpg\">  <strong>   However, upon a closer look  </strong> </a> , the smaller, young craters are pristine, so the image must be sharp and the “blurriness” is due to the processes acting on the terrain. This suggests that the deflation-produced grooves, along with the crater and the caldera, are old features and deflation is not very active today. Alternatively, perhaps these craters are simply too young to show signs of degradation. <br/> <br/> This deeply wind-scoured terrain type is unique to Mars. Wind-carved stream-lined landforms on Earth are called “yardangs,” but they donât form extensive terrains like this one. The basaltic lavas on the flanks of this volcano has been exposed to wind for such a long time that there are no parallels on Earth.

The goddess of the dawn, Eos, fell in love with him and kidnapped him, asking Zeus to make him immortal, but forgetting to ask to make him forever young. When Tithonos reached a very advanced age, only his voice was still young, and Eos no longer wanted him, so Zeus, to save Tithonos from torment, turned him into an insect that would never stop singing: the cicada. <br/> <br/> <br/> Written by: Kristin Block   (28 September 2011) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_023029_1755\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_023029_1755</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_023029_1755", "id": 927, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_023029_1755.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/927/", "slug": "tithonium-chasma", "title": "Tithonium Chasma"}, {"content": "<a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2012/details/cut/ESP_026394_2160-1.jpg\">  <strong>   A dust devil the size of a terrestrial tornado  </strong> </a> towers above the Martian surface in this late springtime afternoon image of Amazonis Planitia. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2012/details/cut/ESP_026394_2160_ctx.jpg\">  <strong>   Also captured by the Context Camera  </strong> </a> on MRO, the length of the shadow indicates that the dust plume reached a height of 20 kilometers (12 miles) above the surface! This height refers to the top of the disconnected dust clouds above the plume; the continuous column of dust reached about half that altitude. Despite its gargantuan height, the plume is only 140 meters (140 yards) in diameter, giving it a snake-like appearance that is twisted by high altitude winds, similar to another dust devil <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_026051_2160\">  <strong>   spotted recently in this region  </strong> </a> . <br/> <br/> Typical tornadoes on Earth are less than 10 miles tall, while dust devils on our planet seldom reach more than a few hundred yards in height. So, why do we classify this plume as a monster dust devil and not a Martian tornado? Dust devils differ from tornadoes in their energy sources. Dust devils are driven by the heat of the surface, absorbed from sunlight and re-radiated to warm the atmosphere. The warm air rises and spins as it contracts, much as a figure skater spins faster as she draws her arms to her sides. <br/> <br/> Tornadoes have an additional energy source: the heat given off as water vapor condenses into liquid rain. The condensing water vapor produces the visible part of a tornado, called the condensation funnel, which is made up of water droplets. On Mars, there is too little water vapor in the atmosphere to contribute significantly to atmospheric convection on local scales. The cloud that we see in this image is produced by dust particles, not raindrops. The astounding heights of Martian dust devils are made possible because mass of an atmospheric column on Mars is less than 1 percent than that of a column on Earth. Transfer of heat from the surface into this less dense atmosphere can produce more vigorous convection, which will penetrate higher into the Martian atmosphere than its counterparts do on Earth. <br/> <br/> Now, what would happen <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2012/details/cut/ESP_026394_2160-2.jpg\">  <strong>   if you were caught in its path?  </strong> </a> Because the density of Mars' atmosphere is so low, even a high velocity dust devil is unlikely to knock you over. However, you might be blasted by any sand or dust particles carried along by the dust devil, which might scratch the visor of your space suit quickly if you were caught outside by this monster! <br/> <br/> This vortex left behind a bright track as its winds disturbed the dust-covered surface, tracing the path of the dust devil from the northwest towards the southeast. A dust \"skirt\" twice as wide as the plume itself is seen near the base of the dust devil, but the bright track is the size of the plume and not the skirt. Dozens of smaller dust devils were also spotted in the same Context Camera scene, steadily vacuuming the surface and pumping dust up into the Martian atmosphere. <br/> <br/> <strong>  VIDEO </strong> <br/> JPL has produced two excellent animations of this dust devil in action. <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"media/clips/Monster-DustDevil-R003.mov\">  <strong>   Clip 1  </strong> </a> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"media/clips/HiRISE-Dust-Devil-Move-03-30-12.mov\">  <strong>   Clip 2  </strong> </a> <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler   (4 April 2012) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_026394_2160\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_026394_2160</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_026394_2160", "id": 1024, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_026394_2160.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1024/", "slug": "a-monster-dust-devil-stalks-the-martian-landscape", "title": "A Monster Dust Devil Stalks the Martian Landscape"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046817_1775\"></div>Tectonic stresses highly modified this area of Ganges Catena, north of Valles Marineris.

It seems likely that ice lenses, resulting from the accumulation of ice beneath the surface, created these peculiar mounds. Ice is less dense than rock, so the buried ice rose and pushed upwards on the surface and generated these spider web-like patterns. An analogous process creates similar sized mounds in arctic tundra on Earth that are known as “pingos,”, an Inuit word. The Martian fractures in this location are nowadays filled with dust instead of ice, so it is unclear how long ago this activity took place. It seems likely that these pingo-forming periglacial processes took place much more recently than the volcanic activity also evident in this region of Mars. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (19 October 2016) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046359_1250\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046359_1250</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046359_1250", "id": 2944, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_046359_1250.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2944/", "slug": "spider-webs", "title": "Spider Webs"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046851_2040\"></div>Nothing gets a geologist more excited than layered bedrock, except perhaps finding a fossil or holding a meteorite in your hand. All of these things create a profound feeling of history, the sense of a story that took place ages ago, long before we came appeared. Layered bedrock in particular tells a story that was set out chapter by chapter as each new layer was deposited on top of older, previously deposited layers. <br/> <br/> Here in Nili Fossae, <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_046851_2040.jpg\">  <strong>   we see layered bedrock as horizontal striations  </strong> </a> in the light toned sediments in the floor of a canyon near Syrtis Major. (Note: illumination is from the top of the picture) The ancient layered rocks appear in pale whitish and bluish tones. They are partially covered by much younger ripples made up of dust and other wind blown sediments. The rock of the nearby canyon wall is severely fractured and appears to have shed sand and rocks and boulders onto the floor. This canyon did not form by fluvial erosion: it is part of a system of faults that formed a series of graben like this one, but water probably flowed through Nili Fossae in the distant past. <br/> <br/> Orbital spectral measurements by the OMEGA instrument on Mars Express and CRISM on MRO detected an abundance of clay minerals of different types in the layered sediments inside Nili Fossae, along with other minerals that are typical of sediments that were deposited by water. The various colors and tones of the layered rocks record changes in the composition of the sediments, details that can tell us about changes in the Martian environment eons ago. Nili Fossae is a candidate site for a future landed robotic mission that could traverse across these layers and make measurements that could be used to unravel a part of the early history of Mars.

Features such as this one are of particular interest as they provide scientists with numerous exposures of bedrock that can be readily observed from orbit and originate from the deep Martian subsurface. <br/> <br/> Unlike on Earth, plate tectonics do not appear to be active on Mars. Thus, much of the Martian subsurface is not directly observable through uplift, erosion and exposure of mountain chains, which provide the majority of bedrock exposures on Earth. Exposures of subsurface materials generated by these features provides us with some of the only âwindowsâ into the subsurface geology. This makes the study of impact craters an invaluable source of information when trying to understand, not only the impact process, but also the composition and history of Mars. <br/> <br/> Although much of what we see here is composed of massive and fractured bedrock, there are zones of rock fragmentation, called “brecciation.” These fragmented rocks (a.k.a., breccias) are best viewed in the eastern portion of the central pit, which was captured <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_046777_1680-3.jpg\">  <strong>   in a previous HiRISE image  </strong> </a> .

Several dunes are on the surface throughout the central pit and surrounding crater floor. <br/> <br/> The mechanisms behind the formation of central features, particularly central pits, are not completely understood. Geologic mapping of these circumferential “mega” blocks of bedrock indicate radial and concentric fracturing that is consistent with deformation through uplift. The exposed bedrock shows well-expressed lineament features that are likely fractures and faults formed during the uplift process. Studies of the bedrock, and such structures in this image, allows us better to understand the formative events and physical processes responsible for their formation. Current research suggests that their formation is the result of some component of uplift followed by collapse. <br/> <br/> Written by: Scott Hutchinson, Livio Tornabene and Nadine Barlow   (9 November 2016) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046777_1680\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046777_1680</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046777_1680", "id": 2946, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_046777_1680.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2946/", "slug": "exposed-fractured-bedrock-in-the-central-pit-of-a-", "title": "Exposed Fractured Bedrock in the Central Pit of a Crater"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046530_2020\"></div>This area of Amazonis Planitia to the west of the large volcano Olympus Mons was once flooded with lava.

The temperature changes on Mars are extreme compared to Earth, because of the lack of humidity in the Martian atmosphere and the eccentricity of the Martian orbit. Each daily temperature cycle and each seasonal change from summer to winter produces a cycle of expansion and contraction that pushes the boulders gradually closer to the brink. <br/> <br/> Inevitably, the boulders fall from their precarious positions and plunge into the canyons below.

A few are launched along downward trajectories, travelling long distances before they settle on the slopes below. <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_046381_1665-2.jpg\">  <strong>   These trundling boulders left behind conspicuous tracks, up to a kilometer long  </strong> </a> . The tracks resemble dashed lines or perforations, indicating that the boulders bounced as they trundled down the slopes. <br/> <br/> The visibility of the boulder tracks suggests that this process may have taken place recently. The active Martian winds quickly erased the tracks of the rover Opportunity, for example. However, the gouges produced by trundling boulders probably go much deeper than the shallow compression of soil by the wheels of a relatively lightweight rover. The boulder tracks might persist for a much longer time span than the rover tracks for this reason. Nevertheless, the tracks of the boulders suggest that erosion of the rim of Eos Chasma is a process that continues today. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler   (9 November 2016) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046381_1665\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046381_1665</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046381_1665", "id": 2948, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_046381_1665.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2948/", "slug": "trundling-boulders", "title": "Trundling Boulders"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_047304_0930\"></div>Many Martian landscapes contain features that are familiar to ones we find on Earth, like river valleys, cliffs, glaciers and volcanos. <br/> <br/> However, Mars has an exotic side too, with landscapes that are alien to Earthlings.

The walls of these venerable gullies have gentle, smooth-looking slopes which contrast with the tall and steep walls of younger gullies.

The weathering processes required to produce such a smooth landscape are very slow and thus must have acted during a long period of time. <br/> <br/> The gullies appear cut by long fractures that criss-cross the crater's walls, and pockmarked by numerous impact craters which are just a few meters (yards) in diameter. According to cross-cutting relationships (used by geologists, archaeologists, and other detective-types to establish relative ages), this means that the gullies must be older than the fractures and small craters. Crater counting is a valuable technique used to estimate the relative age of terrains on Mars and other planetary surfaces; the more time a terrain has been exposed at the surface, the more craters it has accumulated. <br/> <br/> The color and brightness of the gullies is similar to that of their surroundings, probably due to a veneer of undisturbed, homogeneous dust mantling the entire region. <br/> <br/> All these lines of evidence indicate that these gullies have remained inactive for a long period of time. Why are they \"dormant,\" while other Martian gullies appear to show recent activity? Studying both old and young gullies will help us learn more about their processes of formation (erosion from seepage of subsurface water? melting of ground ice or surface snow? dry landslides?).

Typical characteristics of slope streaks are initiation at a point source, one streak splitting into two, deflection around or over obstacles such as small boulders or crater rims, widening below the source area up to a few hundred meters, and lengths of up to a few kilometers. <br/> <br/> Numerous models have been proposed for their formation, both dry- and wet-based. Although there is not one universally accepted model, one key observation up to now was that streaks do not appear to have topographic relief. However, HiRISE images from the first seven months of MRO showed that slope streaks do indeed have topographic relief: the streak interior is lower than its surroundings. There are also many Martian slope streaks that do not appear to have relief; this does not necessarily mean they lack relief, but rather, the relief is below the capability of HiRISE to detect. <br/> <br/> The discovery of topographic relief provides an important clue in that sediment had to be removed for the relief to be present. There are several processes, both wet and dry, that can remove material. A small stream of liquid water running over the surface could carve out the streak area, but liquid water exposed at the surface is not stable under current Martian conditions. Water flowing below the surface, covered by an insulating layer of materials is also possible. <br/> <br/> Other evidence that would favor a wet process are detection of salts, alcoves or channels above the point source, or streaks forming at the intersection of two different geologic layers (i.e., permeable and non-permeable layers). However, there are no documented cases of these thus far. Thus, a dry process is appealing and one of these are dry dust avalanches. <br/> <br/> Further analyses of the slope streaks have documented features related to modification of the streaks. These include ridge-like structures, which have been interpreted to be aeolian ripples. These ripples indicate that saltation of grains within streak beds are occurring on Mars today, and have likely occurred in the recent past. <br/> <br/> Written by: Frank Chuang   (16 June 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002104_1845\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002104_1845</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002104_1845", "id": 740, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_002104_1845.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/740/", "slug": "aeolian-ripples-within-slope-streak-beds", "title": "Aeolian Ripples within Slope Streak Beds"}, {"content": "This observation shows the intersection of several geologic features at the edge of the huge Valles Marineris system of canyons on Mars. <br/> <br/> The circular feature is an impact crater, roughly 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) across. To the south, terrain slopes downward over 4000 meters (13000 feet). Thinking of the crater like a huge drill hole and the canyon wall like a towering road-cut, both features provide a glimpse into the subsurface of the surrounding terrain. <br/> <br/> In the curved north wall of the impact crater, and in the East-West trending, upper walls of the canyon (center of the scene), individual layers of rock can be traced laterally over hundreds to thousands of meters (thousands to tens-of-thousands of feet). The layers appear prominently in the wall because they are stronger, steeper, and more resistant to erosion than materials above and below, which form more gradual slopes. <br/> <br/> In this scene, darker shadows help to distinguish the steeper, rock layers from lighter, gentler slopes, which are covered with broken rocks and dust. Such layers on Mars may have been deposited by the wind, in water, or by volcanic lava flows or ash falls. Thicknesses and sequences of layering can yield information about how many different events were responsible for their formation, the relative volumes of material involved in each event, and whether a repeating pattern of events of similar type and/or size exists. <br/> <br/> The interaction of crater materials and the canyon adds an additional level of interest and complexity to the scene. Normally, when an impact into a layered planetary surface occurs, materials from the center of the crater are pushed downward or blown upward and outward (forming the hole in the ground), while the terrain immediately ringing the crater is tilted upwards to form a relatively narrow, sharp rim as exemplified along the north and southeast edge of this crater. However, the southwest rim of this crater is wider, extends further away from the crater center, is not as circular, and contains several discontinuous pieces of ridges. Either this wall of the crater was pushed further outwards and stretched because the impact occurred near the edge of the canyon (basically allowing the impact to push the wall part-ways over the edge of the canyon), or erosion and expansion of the canyon after formation of the crater has partially undercut the crater wall, causing the wall to slump downwards and outwards. <br/> <br/> In either case, it may be possible to learn something about the impact-induced damage and disruption caused in the ground below the rim of a crater; about the strength and structure of post-impact materials in the crater wall; about the effects of impacts on layers farther away or below the crater, and about processes of erosion, canyon growth, and crater formation. <br/> <br/> Written by: Patrick Russell   (9 June 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_025810_1680\" title=\"ESP_025810_1680\">   ESP_025810_1680  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017740_1680\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017740_1680</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017740_1680", "id": 741, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_017740_1680.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/741/", "slug": "impact-crater-teetering-on-the-edge-of-a-canyon", "title": "Impact Crater Teetering on the Edge of a Canyon"}, {"content": "Stokes is a large, approximately 60 kilometer diameter (38 miles) impact crater located in the Northern lowland plains of Mars. <br/> <br/> Craters this large invariably have a central structural uplift, which form mountain peaks in or near the center of the crater.

Although megabreccia deposits can coat central uplifts, it may not have been the Stokes impact that made this megabreccia. <br/> <br/> The formation of a crater's central uplift does not commonly break up and jumble the deep bedrock.  So if these megabreccias are exposures of the deep bedrock brought up to the surface by the central uplift, and are not merely deposits draped on the central uplift, then it is most likely that these megabreccias were created by much larger and older basin-forming impacts that now lie buried beneath the surface. <br/> <br/> With the aid of high-resolution images, and especially the 3D anaglyphs, we hope to decipher whether the materials observed in the central uplift were formed by the host crater or prior to the formation of that crater. Either way, crater central uplifts can provide windows into the deepest and oldest geologic history of Mars.

Once the snow pack becomes thick enough and compressed to solid ice it will start to flow down hill and becomes glacier. At lower latitudes these alpine glaciers more often occur on poleward facing slopes where sunlight is limited and snow melt is slow. <br/> <br/> On Mars, landforms resembling alpine glaciers are now found to be common at middle latitudes. <br/> <br/> This image shows an example of such a landform at 41 degrees North latitude. Snow and ice accumulated in the mountain valley in the Southern areas of this image, where the rounded valley headwalls (called \"cirques\") were gradually carved out by the slowly flowing ice. This flow of ice is indicated by long stream lines, called \"lateral moraines,\" ridges of rafted soil and rock debris from the cirque regions. <br/> <br/> An interesting aspect of this image is that the flow from these cirques appears to have overtopped the South rim of a large crater at the North end of the image, filling the crater with ice. Once filled the ice flow breached the North rim of this crater and flowed out onto the adjacent plain. Such rapid drops in elevation for a glacier are call \"ice falls,\" analogous to a water fall. Fresh ice falls often exhibit fractured and broken surfaces as the ice flow breaks into crevasses. High resolution images such as this can help scientists to understand the rate and thickness of the flow by examining such characteristics. <br/> <br/> Today Mars is cold, with a global average temperature of about -68 Celsius (-90 Fahrenheit). Mars is also a very dry place and surface ice is unstable everywhere on except for on the polar caps. Any ice left on the surface would evaporate without ever melting, called \"sublimation.\"  However, past climate changes have periodically allowed snow and ice to be stable on the Martian surface and even to build into glacial masses, hundreds of meters (yards) or more thick. In this image, the visible surface is made up of regolith (rock and soil debris) and no ice is visible.

From examining the texture of the surrounding plains and the crater floor, we can conclude that a large lava flow overtopped and cut through a low part of the crater rim and then flowed down the wall of the crater and onto the crater floor, incising (cutting) a channel as it went. This observation is focused on the channel, but a portion of the ponded lava on the crater floor is also visible. <br/> <br/> If you want to get a better look at the crater floor, check out <a href=\"http://viewer.mars.asu.edu/planetview/inst/ctx/P20_008713_1791_XN_00S199W#startthis\">  <strong>   this CTX image  </strong> </a> and this really neat <a href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/anaglyph/singula.php?ID=ESP_018484_1810\">  <strong>   anaglyph.  </strong> </a> From this you can see that the lava covered almost the entire crater floor, however the crater central peak sticks up from the center, an island in the sea of lava. <br/> <br/> This observation was taken to study the channel and breach to learn about the properties of the lava when the flow was active a long time ago.  Since part of the science rationale for taking this observation was to find the relative heights of the ponded lava surface and the surrounding plains as well as to measure the depth of the channel, this site was chosen for <a href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/anaglyph/singula.php?ID=ESP_020963_1810\">  <strong>   stereo coverage  </strong> </a> .

The superposition of one landform or strata above another, fractures and faults that disrupt one layer but not another, and the depths of certain mineralogical signatures all tell a story of the geological and climatological history of the region. <br/> <br/> Intensely fractured bedrock is visible at all scales (meters to kilometers), revealing that subsurface rock has undergone a complex history of stresses and deformation, such as stretching, compression, and twisting. Wider dark ridges are also visible, crossing long distances through the fractured bedrock and between the various exposed layers. These ridges may be what geologists call \"dikes,\" near vertical fissures in the subsurface rock that became injected with magma, and which later cooled into the is now an exposed vein of dark volcanic rock. <br/> <br/> These dikes may be related to areas of dark and rough (likely volcanic) cap rock that now covers and protects the light toned strata below. Erosion through and around this cap rock has exposed a myriad of light toned layers. These layers reveal a past ancient environment where geologic material (perhaps volcanic ash, fine sand, and dust) settled slowly from the air or at the bottom of a standing body of water. In addition, spectroscopic signatures of phyllosilicate minerals (clays) indicates a history of geochemical alteration of primary minerals which in some way involved liquid water. <br/> <br/> These geologic structures and the processes that formed them mostly predate the already ancient flood waters that carved Mawrth Vallis. However, processes continue to change and evolve the landscape into the present day. Overlying the surface are scattered dark dunes and small sand sheets. These landforms tells us that wind continues to move and shift the dark volcanic sands across the surface. In addition, lighter-toned loose soil and coatings of the ever present reddish dust (very fine grained weathered rock particles that is continuously blown around the planet) blankets much of the surface. The presence of this soil tell us that, while slow, rock continues to weather both physically and chemically, and break down into the finer soil particles. <br/> <br/> Written by: Mike Mellon   (10 July 2013) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032125_2025\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032125_2025</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032125_2025", "id": 1165, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_032125_2025.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1165/", "slug": "mawrth-vallis-geodiversity", "title": "Mawrth Vallis Geodiversity"}, {"content": "This HiRISE image shows a wonderfully complex surface on the floor of this ancient flood-carved canyon. <br/> <br/> In this area, the water flowed from the west to the east.

The gray material at upper center has a polygonal pattern when viewed at high resolution.

In reality, faults have very rough surfaces that can create voids as the rocks slide along the fault. Alternatively, the movement of magma (molten rock) underground may have also created such underground voids. As magma moves underground, it pushes aside the bedrock, making an underground tunnel. This tunnel remains behind as the magma drains away and subsequent collapse can occur into it. A combination of processes may also result in pit crater formation, as faults are pre-made passageways for the magma to move underground. <br/> <br/> There is much evidence of faulting in this scene.

These can provide information about the forces which have affected the rock since it formed, which helps unravel the geologic history of this outcrop. <br/> <br/> Written by: Colin Dundas   (11 December 2009) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001865_1695\" title=\"PSP_001865_1695\">   PSP_001865_1695  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001456_1695\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001456_1695</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001456_1695", "id": 20, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_001456_1695.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/20/", "slug": "light-layered-deposits-in-valles-marineris", "title": "Light Layered Deposits in Valles Marineris"}, {"content": "This observation shows a secondary crater field, which form when material ejected from a larger impact event impacts the Martian surface. One impact event, depending on the size of the impactor, can form hundreds of millions of secondary craters at essentially the same time. <br/> <br/> Primary craters (those created directly from an impactor from space) can be the same size as secondary craters, which makes dating surfaces based on the number of accumulated craters difficult to near-impossible. Secondary craters are distinguished from primaries based on their morphologies. They are sometimes irregularly shaped, as seen in this image, because they form at relatively low velocities. The velocity of the impactor determines a craters size, shape, and depth, with lower energy impacts forming shallow, less-developed craters and higher energy impacts forming deeper, more regular craters. <br/> <br/> Secondary craters often occur in clusters, as seen here, as a piece of ejecta breaks up before hitting the surface.

Images from the Mars Orbital Camera (MOC) were the first to reveal that this large impact crater exposed layered rock in its central uplift feature. <br/> <br/> Such beautifully preserved layered rocks, although rare, are no surprise to planetary scientists. First, layered rocks exposed in the central uplifts are common in terrestrial impact structures. Secondly, there is abundant layering exposed in the nearby Valles Marineris canyon system ï¿½ a gash that exposes layering down to 7 kilometers beneath the mean surface. This suggests that layered materials exist to great depths in the subsurface, which is supported by the Oudemans central uplift observation. <br/> <br/> Based on estimates of the depth of excavation for a crater the size of Oudemans, these layers originated from just as deep as those exposed in Valles Marineris and possibly deeper. A comparison of the layers in Valles Marineris and in the Oudemans central uplift may prove that they are similar rock types that share the same mode of origin. The fact that these layers are so well intact gives planetary scientists specific clues regarding the subsurface and history of the general area. <br/> <br/> Additionally, three other craters, Martin (21.2 degrees South, 290.7 degree East), Mazamba (27.3 degrees South, 290.2 degrees East) and a yet unnamed crater (28.4 degrees South, 305 degrees East) also possess finely layered materials in their central uplift features and lie within the circum-Tharsis region. The preservation of the layering and geographical occurrence of these four craters suggests that they could be ash layers deposited from numerous episodes from the Tharsis volcanoes. Voluminous volcanic episodes could have produced large volumes of layered rock that could have been rapidly buried and protected from cratering. <br/> <br/> Written by: Livio Tornabene   (24 February 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002446_1700\" title=\"PSP_002446_1700\">   PSP_002446_1700  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001602_1700\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001602_1700</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001602_1700", "id": 23, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_001602_1700.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/23/", "slug": "oudemans-crater-central-uplift-a-sample-of-well-pr", "title": "Oudemans Crater Central Uplift: A Sample of Well-Preserved Layering"}, {"content": "The bottom half of this observation shows a portion of a frost patch on a mound inside a northern hemisphere crater.

In the northeast part of the image one sinuous ridge appears superposed on another, supporting this hypothesis. <br/> <br/> The linear ridges may be yardangs.

In fact, very few definite impact craters are seen on the floor and walls of Mojave, implying that it is incredibly young and relatively well preserved for a crater of its size. <br/> <br/> HiRISE images covering Mojave crater and the surrounding region are yielding new insights into impact processes on Mars. <br/> <br/> Written by: James Wray and Livio Tornabene   (3 February 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002602_1875\" title=\"PSP_002602_1875\">   PSP_002602_1875  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002101_1875\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002101_1875</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002101_1875", "id": 30, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_002101_1875.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/30/", "slug": "mojave-crater-floor-and-central-uplift", "title": "Mojave Crater Floor and Central Uplift"}, {"content": "Previous images of this area by other space missions indicate that this is a shield volcano with very shallow slopes.

Sand dunes form as wind-blown particles roll across the surface and accumulate. Since the air on Mars is very thin, sand dunes take much longer to form on Mars than they do on Earth. The presence of large sand dunes, along with many small impact craters, on top of this landslide indicates that movement of the slide occurred a very long time ago, perhaps hundreds of millions of years. <br/> <br/> This landslide was probably caused by a strong earthquake. A nearby meteorite impact may have generated an earthquake that was sufficiently strong to cause this landslide. Alternatively, movement along nearby faults may have triggered the landslide. <br/> <br/> The Valles Marineris region is cut by many faults and in fact contains many more landslides such as this one.

The fractures appear dark; this may be due to trapping of dark, wind-blown sand in the crack, to precipitation of different minerals along the fracture, or both. <br/> <br/> Written by: Colin Dundas   (7 July 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001860_1685\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001860_1685</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001860_1685", "id": 71, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_001860_1685.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/71/", "slug": "light-outcrop-on-crater-floor", "title": "Light Outcrop on Crater Floor"}, {"content": "This observation is a view of the sand dune field in Richardson Crater covered with seasonal frost. <br/> <br/> The <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2010/details/cut/PSP_002542_1080_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   subimage is a close-up view  </strong> </a> of defrosting patterns on the dunes.

Perhaps the most notable features in the image are the distinct round to heart-shaped to blob-shaped depressions scattered throughout the smooth areas, dubbed \"swiss-cheese terrain.\" <br/> <br/> The smooth material is solid carbon dioxide ice representing the uppermost layer of the south polar residual cap. The retention of carbon dioxide ice throughout the year by the southern polar cap is one characteristic that distinguishes it significantly from Mars' north polar cap. The swiss-cheese depressions are areas in which sublimation of the carbon dioxide ice was initiated at a particular location and spread laterally from that point, creating rounded depressions typically several to 10 meters deep. <br/> <br/> In HiRISE images, it is evident that this carbon dioxide-rich material is actually comprised of several individual horizontal layers.

A major debate is whether this water comes from the surface (i.e., melting surface ice or melting snow) or the subsurface (i.e., from an aquifer).

It is also possible that the layer preferentially traps ice or snow that may melt to form gullies, thus providing a surface source of water to form the gullies. <br/> <br/> Please note that the stripe-like features on the left side of the image are camera artifacts and not real features. <br/> <br/> Written by: Kelly Kolb   (8 September 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002014_1415\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002014_1415</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002014_1415", "id": 83, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_002014_1415.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/83/", "slug": "gullies-in-trough-near-gorgonum-chaos", "title": "Gullies in Trough near Gorgonum Chaos"}, {"content": "This observation covers an alluvial fan along the wall of a large crater in the mid latitudes of the Southern hemisphere of Mars. <br/> <br/> The fan was formed when water and sediments drained down the steep wall of the crater creating a cone-shaped pile of debris at the base.

As the obliquity changes, the portions of Mars that receive the most sunlight shift. During periods of high obliquity, polar regions receive the most sunlight. This causes polar ices, including water ice and carbon dioxide ice, to sublimate (evaporate) into the atmosphere.

Ice would have acted as a lubricant, facilitating the flow of rocks and soils and hence smoothing landscape's features such as ridges and craters' rims. <br/> <br/> The concentric and radial fissures in the crater's floor may indicate decrease of volume due to loss of underground ice. Piles of rocks aligned along these fissures and arranged forming polygons are similar to features observed in terrestrial periglacial regions such as Antarctica. Antarctica's features are produced by repeated expansion and contraction of subsurface soil and ice, due to seasonal temperature oscillations.

The darktoned sand however, contains many more impact craters than the lighttoned bedrock. This suggests that the surface of the bedrock is younger than the veneer of sand. <br/> <br/> This can be explained by the bedrock being more easily eroded by the wind than the veneer of sand. The surface of the bedrock is rapidly refreshed (craters smoothed away), while the sand veneer retains impact craters for a longer period of time. This indicates that the bedrock is very friable (weak and easily eroded, in this case by the wind) and the sand veneer is less friable. <br/> <br/> Written by: Chris Okubo   (20 October 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002550_1725\" title=\"PSP_002550_1725\">   PSP_002550_1725  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003618_1725\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003618_1725</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003618_1725", "id": 121, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_003618_1725.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/121/", "slug": "strengths-of-materials-in-ganges-mensa", "title": "Strengths of Materials in Ganges Mensa"}, {"content": "This observation shows gullies in a Southern hemisphere crater, whose floor has large mounds of material that are likely slump blocks that fell off the crater walls during a late stage of formation.

The ridge is most likely a former streambed, now exposed in inverted relief; the wandering path is not expected for an exhumed fault or volcanic dyke.

Here, the ridge is distant from any volcanic vent, and appears fractured, particularly in the southern portion. This indicates that the ridge material is consolidated and has some strength.

These cracks could form by desiccation (water loss) from wet sediment or tensile fracturing as the weight of overlying rocks was removed.

On Earth the oceans serve as dust traps, but on Mars, it is the high volcanos. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen   (20 October 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_012310_1715\" title=\"ESP_012310_1715\">   ESP_012310_1715  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004412_1715\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004412_1715</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004412_1715", "id": 136, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_004412_1715.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/136/", "slug": "layers-in-arsia-mons-volcano", "title": "Layers in Arsia Mons Volcano"}, {"content": "This HiRISE image is of a region east of the Hellas impact basin and south of Reull Vallis.

The SPLD are composed of layers of water ice mixed with impurities (probably mostly dust). The most similar terrestrial analog to the SPLD are ice sheets, like those covering most of Greenland and Antarctica. <br/> <br/> The materials of ice sheets are deposited by freezing of atmospheric water vapor on dust particles and precipitation of those water/dust particles (snow), by direct condensation (freezing) of atmospheric water vapor onto the surface, and by fallout of dust. Together, these processes cause an ice sheet to undergo accumulation (build-up). Ablation (removal of material, also called erosion) of an ice sheet can also occur. If more accumulation happens than ablation, the ice sheet grows; if reversed, the ice sheet shrinks, as is the case for many of Earths glaciers due to global warming. Each year, the amount of accumulation and ablation varies, so layers of different thicknesses and different amounts of impurities (dust) will be deposited onto the ice sheet. <br/> <br/> Volcanic eruptions anywhere on the planet can also potentially spew ash high into the atmosphere, where it can travel great distances and fall onto an ice sheet surface. Later accumulations of water ice can then trap this volcanic ash as a layer within the ice sheet. Thus, layers in an ice sheet can originate through a variety of means and occur at a variety of scales (thicknesses). <br/> <br/> This particular image is interesting because many layers are exposed and because more than one outcrop (exposure of layering) is visible—at the top of the image and at the bottom. You can imagine the outcrops at the top and bottom of the image as if you are looking down on a staircase. The approximately horizontal lines are the edges of the layers (the risers), and the flat areas between them are the layer surfaces (the flat parts of the steps). The middle of the image is the top of the staircase.  At the bottom, the staircase of layers goes down again. <br/> <br/> The layers in this image are on the scale of meters (several to tens of feet) in thickness and are much thicker than one might expect from annual accumulation (which might be about 0.5 millimeters per year, or 0.02 inch per year). So the layers we see in this image may be packages of thinner, annual layers. The reason that we can distinguish between different packages of annual layers (in other words, the reason that we can see layering at this scale) is because the rates of accumulation and ablation change not only yearly, but also on much longer time scales. Imagine drilling into the SPLD and looking at the walls of the hole with a microscope. Within the large-scale layering we see in this image, we might see annual accumulation layers, dusty layers created during large dust storms, and maybe even volcanic ash layers. <br/> <br/> Written by: Kate Fishbaugh   (14 August 2007) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004664_0955\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004664_0955</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004664_0955", "id": 143, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_004664_0955.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/143/", "slug": "outcrops-of-layers-in-the-south-polar-layered-depo", "title": "Outcrops of Layers in the South Polar Layered Deposits"}, {"content": "This image shows a portion of a mound partly filling an impact crater.

The polygons outlined by the fractures are typically a few hundred meters (approximately 1000 feet) across, and traverse layer boundaries. Such polygonal fractures are seen on Earth in places where ground ice is present, and previous Mars orbiters have found evidence for abundant ground ice in the south polar region of Mars. So it is not surprising to see polygonal fractures here; what is unusual is that they cross layer boundaries, apparently unaffected by the changes in slope across them. <br/> <br/> This suggests that the polygonal fractures formed after the scarp exposing the south polar layered deposits was formed by erosion.

Volcanic eruptions would not be expected to produce ash or volcanic flows of such regular thickness, and there are no nearby volcanic vents. <br/> <br/> Some of the layering in the image appears dark, probably due to deposition of basalt sand along flatter surfaces rather than any compositional variations in the layer beds themselves. Faults can also be seen displacing portions of the layered beds. The surface of the light-toned deposit is not smooth but instead appears disrupted into polygonal cracks and blocks. <br/> <br/> Relative to most surfaces on Mars, there are almost no impact craters seen in this image. This is not due to a young age but rather to the friable (easily eroded) nature of the light-toned layered deposits that enable wind easily to erode the unit, thereby removing any impact craters. Evidence of erosion by the wind is most apparent in the bottom of the image where linear ridges most likely formed by wind scouring away material in a North-South direction and creating the ridges. <br/> <br/> Written by: Cathy Weitz   (6 October 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005845_2015\" title=\"PSP_005845_2015\">   PSP_005845_2015  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003656_2015\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003656_2015</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003656_2015", "id": 172, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_003656_2015.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/172/", "slug": "lots-of-layering-in-becquerel-crater", "title": "Lots of Layering in Becquerel Crater"}, {"content": "Nili Fossae is a region that is thought to be approximately 3.5 billion years in age and, based on results from Omega, is the largest exposure of olivine (a common dark colored rock forming mineral found in igneous rocks) on the surface of Mars.

Terraced fans are rare deposits on Mars: they have only been seen in a few dozen locations. <br/> <br/> On Earth, terraced fans are found in alluvial environments and in deltas. When water flowing down steep slopes, such as mountains or hills, encounters a flatter surface, the sediments carried by the water are deposited along the shallow slopes to form alluvial fans. Deltas can also produce terraced fans when water from rivers and streams meets oceans or lakes; a delta deposit results at the contact between the confined, fast-moving water (river/stream) and the open body of water (ocean/lake). <br/> <br/> The fact that this Martian terraced fan is found adjacent to a valley supports the hypothesis that water was the mechanism that transported and deposited the material that now forms the fan.

The two most noticeable features in this scene are craters on mesas (plateaus) and raised, winding ridges. <br/> <br/> The raised ridges are inverted channels. It is likely that liquid water, either pure or salt water, flowed through these channels. The channels are raised because streams transport sediment as they flow, deposit the heavier sediment on the stream floor, and, eventually fill in once their water supply dwindles.  Over time, wind erosion modifies a landscape, and this has played an important role on these plains. It eroded the land around the channels leaving the remnant channels exposed and standing high. The channels did not erode as much since they were more resistant, possibly because the deposited sediment had cemented together. <br/> <br/> The craters on mesas are also evidence of active wind erosion. When craters form, they eject material out onto the surrounding landscape. It appears that several of the craters ejecta visible here cemented, making the ejecta more resistant to erosion and leaving them standing high as craters on plateaus. <br/> <br/> <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005346_1755_cut_b.jpg\">  The subimage </a> (approximately 1120 meters across) shows a juncture of two of the inverted channels.

The layers appear to have bent and flowed rather than just broken via faulting, perhaps because the sediments were wet or rich in ice.Written by: Alfred   (16 December 2007) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007056_1410\" title=\"PSP_007056_1410\">   PSP_007056_1410  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_006133_1410\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_006133_1410</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_006133_1410", "id": 225, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_006133_1410.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/225/", "slug": "complex-folded-terrain-on-the-floor-of-hellas-basi", "title": "Complex Folded Terrain on the Floor of Hellas Basin"}, {"content": "This observation shows rock outcrops in Meridiani Planum, in the area of the landing site of the <a href=\"http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/home/index.html\">  Mars Exploration Rover, </a> Opportunity. The image is centered on a cluster of buttes, steep-sided erosional remnants protruding from a level plain. There are two broad categories of material in the image: light-toned sedimentary rock and dark-toned material, which is likely wind-blown sand. <br/> <br/> The light-toned material was probably deposited as sediments transported by wind or water; Opportunity found outcrops of aeolian (wind-deposited) sandstone, and this may also be the case in the area of this image. The dark areas show ripples formed by material (probably grains of sand eroded from basaltic lava) blowing in the wind. <br/> <br/> In the RGB enhanced-color image (which is not what the colors would like to the naked eye), the dark material is relatively blue, while the light rock ranges from pale blue to tan. The pale blue color in some cases may be due to small amounts of basaltic sand overlying relatively tan rock outcrops, but could also be a real difference due to varying composition or cementation of the rock. <br/> <br/> The presence of buttes like those at the image center suggests rock layers of varying resistance. Relatively hard, resistant rock on top can armor a patch of weaker material below; this is commonly observed on Earth. Relations like this are found at many sites in the Colorado Plateau (the Four Corners area of the United States), which has been used as an analogue for this region on Mars.

This feature is near a large volcano, so perhaps there were explosive magma-water interactions that violently removed the water and some magma, followed by surface collapse. Or, less violently, there could have been simple melting of subsurface ice and then collapse of the surface into the resulting void. The rays emanating from the depression suggest some amount of violence before the surface collapse that sprayed material far from the depression. <br/> <br/> Some aspects of this and other, nearby features are similar to the collapse pits associated with <a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1703-01=\">  Grímsvötn </a> volcano in Iceland, which erupts beneath an ice-cap.

The number of impact craters on a planetary surface is often used to estimate the age of that surface (because the older a surface is, the more time that surface has had to accumulate craters, and thus the more craters that surface will have on it, assuming a constant cratering rate). The polar layered deposits on Mars are believed to be very young because there are no large craters on them and very few small craters. The high resolution of HiRISE will enable these craters to be studied in detail, perhaps allowing the number of craters—and thus the surface age—to be better constrained. <br/> <br/> A problem with using craters to determine age on the icy polar layered deposits is that erosion of the icy substrate and relaxation of crater topography (i. e., relief becoming more gentle) is probably more rapid on ice than on harder rocky surfaces. A detailed study of craters in ice will help better to understand this process of how craters in ice degrade, or deteriorate, with time.

V-shaped patterns in the rays  referred to as a herringbone pattern  are identical to those around fresh lunar craters. These form when materials are ejected from the crater at a very low angle, which form clusters of secondary craters that preferentially eject materials down-range in a V-shaped pattern. (Its the same pattern that you would get when shooting a water pistol nearly parallel to a sidewalk.) <br/> <br/> Also noteworthy are the large meter-to-decimeter-sized boulders on the  steep rim that have not been buried or physically weathered to smaller sizes in this windy region, indicating that they have not been exposed long. This is also reminiscent of Meteor Crater and examples of fresh simple craters on the Moon. <br/> <br/> The ring of rocky, cliff-forming materials in the inner wall of the crater represents original bedrock that was uplifted and exposed by the impact. The characteristic morphology is called spur and gully consisting of both the protruding bedrock inter-fingered with debris shoots feeding fans of sandy materials that extend down to the crater floor. Throughout this region, the present-day surface consists of a mix of global dust and volcanic sands from the Syrtis Major complex that typically cover the local bedrock. Winslow Crater is an excellent example of how craters can provide a window into the subsurface by exposing the local bedrock within the ejecta and crater wall. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Second Image </strong> <br/> Later, a second HiRISE image of Winslow ( <a href=\"/PSP_005658_1760\">  PSP_005658_1760 </a> ) was <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2008/details/cut/PSP_005658_1760_cut_b.jpg\">  taken to obtain a stereo-pair </a> useful for determining the relief and topography of the crater and its surroundings. By chance this second image was taken after the dust storm that enveloped the planet in June 2007. Dust deposited during this storm blanketed the region and largely obscured the brightness differences between the dark rays and the surrounding bright soil. Laboratory experiments on natural surfaces indicate that a layer of dust only a few tens of microns thick is sufficient to achieve such obscuration. The thin dark lines that cross the later image show that dust-devils have already begun the work of cleansing the surface of dust and restoring the region to its previous appearance. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Naming the Crater </strong> <br/> Due to its similar size and remote thermal infrared (TIR) characteristics similar to Meteor Crater, Arizona, the name Winslow Crater was suggested after the small town roughly 20 km to the east of Meteor Crater, and the International Astronomical Unions committee on Planetary Nomenclature agreed.

Most of the isolated mesas have white-ish tops; however, some (near the foot of the SPLD scarp) have reddish tops. This may either be due to bright carbon dioxide ice thinning to reveal the older (and darker) carbon dioxide ice that makes up the main body of the mesa, or perhaps dust has settled out of the atmosphere to cover the brighter frost.

It is a large crater blasted into the northern rim of the gargantuan Hellas Basin. Both of these holes in the crust of Mars were formed by impacts with asteroids or comets early in the planets geologic history. <br/> <br/> Large impacts excavate material from deep within the crust, allowing a rover to access rocks that otherwise would require a massive drilling rig. Since the interior of Mars is warm enough for liquid water, these rocks are of great interest in the search for possible ancient life on the Red Planet. <br/> <br/> As this HiRISE image shows, Terby Crater is interesting for additional reasons. The curving ridges most prominent near the center of the image look like stream channels.  However, unlike normal channels, the interior is higher than the surroundings. One way features like this form on Earth is called topographic inversion. Stream beds can become lined with larger gravels or cobbles, making them quite resistant to erosion, so with time, the surroundings are removed and the originally low channel is left standing high (and dry). <br/> <br/> Another way similar features form is when a stream is flowing underneath a glacier. In this case the liquid water is confined by ice on either side and the sediments can build up. When the ice is removed, a ridge of these sediments is left behind. These are called eskers by geologists. While further examination of this and similar HiRISE images may be able to distinguish between these possibilities, a rover would allow more detailed studies. <br/> Written by: Laszlo P.

Here, many streaks appear brighter than the surrounding undisturbed slope surface, and the origin of these bright streaks is not entirely clear. <br/> <br/> <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007162_1915_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   In this subimage,  </strong> </a> it is apparent that dark streak always appear to be on top of the bright streaks, indicating that the dark streaks are younger.Written by: Brad Thomson   (30 March 2008) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007162_1915\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007162_1915</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007162_1915", "id": 321, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_007162_1915.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/321/", "slug": "mysterious-bright-and-dark-slope-streaks-in-arabia", "title": "Mysterious Bright and Dark Slope Streaks in Arabia Terra"}, {"content": "Gale Crater is a large (152 kilometer diameter) crater in the cratered highlands of Mars near the highland/lowland divide.

At the bottom of the valley and in the lower portion of the valley walls are many large dunes. <br/> <br/> The slope streaks generally start at a point source and widen downslope as a single streak or branch into multiple streaks. Some of the slope streaks show evidence that downslope movement is being diverted around obstacles, such as large boulders. In particular, several of the slope streaks in this image appear to be diverting around individual dunes, with downslope movement occurring in the low troughs between the dunes. The darkest slope streaks are youngest and cross cut and lie on top of the older and lighter-toned streaks. The lighter-toned streaks are believed to be dark streaks that are lightening with time as new dust is deposited on their surface. <br/> <br/> Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars. Since the slope streaks in this image appear to superpose (lie on top of) the surfaces between individual dunes, the streaks most likely formed more recently and are younger than the dunes. <br/> <br/> Many hypotheses have been proposed for the formation of slope streaks including dry avalanching, geochemical weathering, liquid stains or flows, and moisture wickering. Recent observations from HiRISE images have revealed that the dark interior of slope streaks is lower in elevation than the surroundings, suggesting that material must have been removed in the formation of the streak.

Most of the flat parts of the image have a polygonal texture, which commonly forms when mud dries.

Their presence has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation (ice going directly from the solid state to the gas state). Their formation most likely involves development of oval- to scalloped-shaped depressions that may coalesce together, leading to the formation of large areas of pitted terrain. Scalloped pits typically have a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentler equator-facing slope. <br/> <br/> On the surface surrounding the scalloped depressions is a polygonal pattern of fractures. This is commonly associated with scalloped terrain, and indicates that the surface has undergone stress, potentially caused by subsidence (sinking), desiccation (drying out), or thermal contraction. These polygon features are similar to permafrost polygons that form in polar and high alpine regions on Earth by seasonal-to-annual contraction of the subsoil.

Where they appear together, dark slope streaks cross cut and lie on top of the older and lighter-toned streaks leading to the belief that lighter-toned streaks are dark streaks that have lightened with time as new dust settled on their surface.

This rock is fractured but not disrupted; such fractures are called joints by geologists.

The solidifying surface of aa lavas are broken up as the flow moves, producing a carapace of debris surrounding the liquid lava. When the lava flow finally stops, the liquid interior freezes into a hard layer. The contraction during cooling produces irregular jointing like that seen in this HiRISE image.Written by: Laszlo P.

Scalloped pits typically have a steep pole-facing scarp (north in this observation) and a shallower equator-facing slope. <br/> <br/> Formation of scalloped depressions may be a process that is still active today. <br/> <br/> Written by: Maria Banks   (29 April 2008) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007930_2310\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007930_2310</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007930_2310", "id": 378, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_007930_2310.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/378/", "slug": "dissected-mantle-terrain-and-scallops-in-tempe-ter", "title": "Dissected Mantle Terrain and Scallops in Tempe Terra"}, {"content": "Schroeter Crater is an approximately 300 kilometer (185 mile) diameter crater near the equator that is highly degraded. <a href=\"http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006700_006799/PSP_006726_1830/PSP_006726_1830_RED.abrowse.jpg\">  <strong>   The full image  </strong> </a> shows part of the west floor of the crater. <br/> <br/> The floor is speckled with other craters, most of which are degraded; the largest entire crater in the scene (image above) has a sharp rim, indicating that it is relatively young.

The water ice is what gives the apron its unique texture, which is especially clear at HiRISE's high resolution. Parallel ridges and grooves  indicate material has moved slowly while remaining solid - a process called \"creep.\"  Pits and buttes may have formed when the dust- and debris-covered ice cracked and sublimated (went directly from a solid to a gas phase). <br/> <br/> We can also use this HiRISE image to study the small impact craters found in these areas. Debris aprons like this one have fewer craters than their surroundings. Because impacts generally occur indiscriminately over all of Mars, this means that either the debris apron is younger than its surroundings, or some process is erasing craters on the apron - a process which is not occurring as rapidly on the surrounding plains. <br/> <br/> The fact that this apron is rich in water ice is a clue to what is happening. Another clue is the craters on the apron themselves: they have a <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2010/details/cut/PSP_007832_1385_cut2.jpg\">  <strong>   different appearance  </strong> </a> than most craters. <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2010/details/cut/PSP_007832_1385_cut3.jpg\">  <strong>   Some of these degraded craters  </strong> </a> are \"inverted\" (higher in the middle than at the edges, which is the opposite of normal craters). <br/> <br/> Craters like this have been modified, so we can tell the surface has been active at some time since the impact that formed the crater. For this reason we can't estimate the age of the flow by counting craters, like we are be able to do on some surfaces. However, we can use these craters to study the processes that are actively modifying the apron material. <br/> <br/> Written by: Ingrid Daubar   (3 March 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007832_1385\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007832_1385</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007832_1385", "id": 398, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_007832_1385.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/398/", "slug": "craters-on-an-ice-rich-debris-apron", "title": "Craters on an Ice-Rich Debris Apron"}, {"content": "Mars has a vast sea of sand dunes in the high latitude region encircling its North polar cap, known as the North polar erg.

Some of this sandy material is being removed from the cliff face and is forming new dunes at the foot of the cliff.Written by: Shane Byrne   (11 June 2008) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008244_2645\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008244_2645</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008244_2645", "id": 404, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_008244_2645.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/404/", "slug": "north-polar-layered-deposits", "title": "North Polar Layered Deposits"}, {"content": "This image shows a portion of the southern highlands cut by Arda Valles, an ancient valley network. <br/> <br/> The valley network is degraded as seen by the lack of obvious walls and a V-shaped bottom.

The dark patches and streaks show sand that has begun escaping from a blanket of seasonal frost. <br/> <br/> Many of the typical types of Martian dunes are similar to common dunes on Earth. <strong>  Transverse </strong> dunes have gentle upwind slopes and steep lee sides that are perpendicular to the wind direction. <strong>  Barchans </strong> are crescent-shaped dunes with a gentle upwind slope and steep lee with horns.

The drawn out limbs and remnant slip-faces were apparently produced by variations in the wind direction. The winds that created the transverse dunes blow from a single easterly direction, while the modified barchans are shaped by winds from an easterly-northeasterly direction. The elongated horns align parallel to northeasterly winds. These wind variations could be caused by local topography. <br/> <br/> Two factors likely contribute to the unique morphology of these dunes. First, the southern horns defrost sooner than the northern horns because they receive sunlight more directly. This enables material to move more easily on their southern side. Second, the changing wind directions may be reorienting the dunes. One idea is that the barchans southern horns are being blown downwind into linear (seif-like) dunes, with sinuous crests and steep flanks. Another possible explanation is that they are drifts of sand ( <strong>  lee </strong> dunes) that form in the lee of an obstacle. The frozen barchans might act as obstacles to the wind, allowing loose sand to accumulate in their lee.

Secondary airflow maintains the dune arms. The last factor is the deposition or removal of the sand by grainfall or grainflow avalanching. Grainfall and grainflow transports material from the main crestline slipface and along-slope or down-slope which maintains the secondary arm crest. <br/> <br/> Written by: Circe Verba   (7 July 2008) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008323_1735\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008323_1735</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008323_1735", "id": 409, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_008323_1735.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/409/", "slug": "tars-and-unusual-star-ripples", "title": "TARs and Unusual Star Ripples"}, {"content": "Mars’ seasonal cap of carbon dioxide ice (dry ice) has eroded many beautiful terrains as it sublimates (goes directly from ice to vapor) every spring.

Lava flows are abundant in the region south and west of Arsia Mons and most of them appear like runny wax, especially in images that cover large areas at low resolutions. <br/> <br/> But this HiRISE image shows that while many features of lava flows occur on the older lava flows, the surfaces have also been smoothed over in many places by mobile, fine-grained materials.

Up close, even younger lava flows have their share of mantling materials deposited on their surfaces. <br/> <br/> This image also shows how lava flows advanced by sprouting small fingers and toes of lava along their margins. These in turn become the pathways for more lavas and eventual  accumulations that spread over these toes and fingers. Most of the surface of the lava flow appears to be a complex in some places, and in others, patterned ridges formed during complex jostling of the brittle and solid crust that formed on the lava flow even as it was still moving. <br/> <br/> In the southern half of this image there are several areas of aligned pits and channels.

The resolution of the Viking images was insufficient to show more than the mere presence of small shield volcanoes and the fact that they appeared to line up along a linear trend across the floor. And, it was suspected that the small shield volcanoes were the source of the lava flows that appeared to cover the floor of the caldera, but details have been elusive. <br/> <br/> This HiRISE image of the central small shield volcano on the caldera floor shows that there are numerous lava flows radiating from a small summit crater. To the north and south, the lavas have accumulated in lobes, some of which radiate smaller channels and lobes. About midway from the crater, to both the top and bottom of the image, the surface appears very smooth and there are few details visible. Until detailed geologic mapping is done, it is difficult to conclude whether these smooth areas represent distal ponding of lavas that erupted from the summit crater of the small shield volcano, lava flows that have invaded from outside the image area at a time later than the formation of the small shield volcano, or later deposits of dust and ash that have simply covered the surface. <br/> <br/> Whatever the relationships, it is clear that the floor of the largest caldera on Mars is far from a bland surface of old lava flows.

The lava surface consists of ridged plates that have rafted apart with smoother lava filling between the plates.

In a process that is not yet completely understood, sheets of saltating sand grains organize themselves into sand dunes, visible in this image as the dark features. <br/> <br/> Sand dunes move by having the wind push sand grains up and over the top of the dune where they then slide down to the base. The steep side of the dune that the sand grains slide down is called the slip-face and it is the constant transport of sand from the downwind side of the dune to the slip-face that makes the dune move forward in this direction. HiRISE data allow us to see which side of these dunes has the steeper slope (the slip-face), telling us what direction the dune—and strong near surface winds—are moving (in this case the slip-faces point almost directly to the left). <br/> <br/> Yet something else is also happening to these particular dunes. Dark streaks lead away from the dunes toward the lower left of the image. These streaks are caused by sand grains being blown off the dunes and saltating away. This is not ordinarily a cause for concern because in a stable dune, individual grains are constantly added and removed; however, there does not appear to be any influx of sand upwind of these dunes, so they are probably being eroded. <br/> <br/> It is also interesting that these streaks do not point in the same direction as the slip-face. One possible scenario is that the dunes migrated westward when sand supply was more plentiful. Today, the wind direction has shifted, blowing more toward the southwest, and the influx of new sand has ceased, such that in the future, the dunes will completely erode away.

Blue tones are usually associated with basaltic rock. The blue ripples found on the trough floor could be wind-blown sand comprised of fine fragments of basalt. The upper plains are a relatively bland tone, perhaps due to a thin coating of dust; however, impact craters in the image also show bluish boulders and ripples, indicating that they have excavated the same basaltic rock layers cut by the fossae. This is typical of the region, as floods of lava coat much of the area. <br/> <br/> The mesas of older rock just north of the fissures are remnants of a former surface, now eroded. The surrounding region has many knobs and larger protruding topography, which may be remnants of the same materials. The topmost layer in each mesa is very resistant to weathering, as in places it actually overhangs the lower rocks. This cap layer could be solidified lava, although it appears somewhat bland in color. <br/> <br/> Although the mesa is clearly eroded and the cap rock breaks up into boulders, few rocks are visible at the bottom of the slope.

The smaller, rounder crater formed when an asteroid collided with Mars. This impact blasted out the pre-existing rocks, forming this quasi-circular crater. <br/> <br/> The larger, more irregular-shaped crater is a pit crater. These types of craters form through collapse of the ground surface into large underground voids. In this region of Mars, these underground voids are likely caused by the movement of magma (molten rock) through the subsurface. As the magma moves underground, it forces the rock apart and forms large “caverns.” These voids are structurally unstable and can lead to collapse of the overlying rock, forming pit craters at the surface. <br/> <br/> Impact craters are distinguished from pit craters by the presence of a raised rim. Rock blasted out during the impact falls back to the ground and accumulates near the crater, forming this raised rim. Upward warping of the ground during the impact process also contributes to the raised appearance of the crater rim. Since pit craters form through collapse, their rims are at the same level, or perhaps slightly lower, than surrounding ground surface. <br/> <br/> The impact crater has a bright streak extending southeast (toward the <a href=\"http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_009000_009099/PSP_009039_1660/PSP_009039_1660_RED.abrowse.jpg\">  <strong>   lower right  </strong> </a> ).

This influences the movement of sand within the crater and the dunes that they shape. <br/> <br/> This image shows many transitioning dunes which indicate changes of wind direction. The wind direction can be inferred from the location of the steeper side of the dune (called the slip-face) which is downwind of the dominant wind direction. The barchans and barchanoid dunes form crescent shapes and are consistent with dominant winds from the southwest. <br/> <br/> Towards the center of the dune field, the barchans transition from crescent shapes into irregular, more elongated dunes and merge. The more northern part of the dune field consists of longitudinal dunes which extend from the horns of modified barchans in the central part of the dune field. These longitudinal dunes form along the trend of southerly-southeasterly winds. <br/> <br/> Because it is early summer, solar radiation has heated the sand and there are only a few small patches of frost remaining on the dunes at this season. However,  evidence of the arctic climate is visible in the polygons surrounding the dune field. The polygons, like those found at the Phoenix Mission landing site, are produced by freeze-thaw cycles as the polar soil expands and contracts. <br/> <br/> Written by: Circe Verba/P Geissler   (4 September 2008) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009087_2550\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009087_2550</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009087_2550", "id": 477, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_009087_2550.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/477/", "slug": "crater-bound-dunes", "title": "Crater Bound Dunes"}, {"content": "Because HiRISE images resolve details at scales less than a meter, this image and others similar to it of uneroded impact craters, offer opportunities to examine the details of the impact cratering process. <br/> <br/> This is a very well-preserved crater in the northern hemisphere.

The north part of the image shows striations on the ejecta that formed from the impact blast. The crater rim has a large number of bright landslides, probably resulting from slumping on steep, unstable slopes that are typical of well-preserved craters. <br/> <br/> Some of the terraces within the crater have fluvial-like channels which might have been carved shortly after crater formation from impact-induced precipitation.

There is a conical mound part-way down the slope that is approximately 40 m (130 ft) high. One possible explanation for this anomaly is that it may be the remnant of a buried impact crater that is now being exhumed. As the NPLD accumulated, impacts occurred throughout its surface which were then buried by additional ice. These buried craters are generally inaccessible to us, but in a few rare locations, erosion that forms a trough (like this one) can uncover these buried structures. For reasons that are poorly understood right now, the ice beneath the site of the crater is more resistant to this erosion, so when material is removed in forming the trough the ice beneath the old impact site remains, creating this isolated hill. <br/> <br/> An inspection of the full-resolution data shows that polygonal blocks, up to 10 m (33 feet) across, make up this mound.

Neither crater shows signs of burial by ejecta from the other. More importantly, the ejecta (material thrown out of the craters) shows signs of interacting; the ridges extending to the southeast of the crater probably formed when ejecta from the craters collided in midair, causing more debris to pile up at certain points. This means that the impacts occurred within moments of each other. <br/> <br/> Ejecta interaction features like this can also form in association with \"secondary\" craters (craters made by debris from other impacts, rather than by asteroids), since many secondary craters form at once. In this case, however, a binary asteroid is the likely cause.

Deuteronilus Mensae is located on the northern edge of Arabia Terra and borders the high-standing, heavily-cratered southern hemisphere and the low, uncratered plains that cover most of the northern hemisphere of Mars. The region is characterized by hills and mesas surrounded by debris slopes and broad valleys. <br/> <br/> Many of the valley floors in the Dueteronilus Mensae region exhibit complex alignments of small ridges and pits often called \"lineated valley fill.\" The cause of the small-scale texture is not well understood, but may result from patterns in ice-rich soils or ice loss due to sublimation (ice changing into water vapor). The linear alignment may be caused by downhill movement of ice-rich soil or by glacial flow. For example, flowing ice on Earth typically develops wrinkles or ridges and pits due to stresses in the ice as it moves. The result is flow patterns, called \"stream lines\" that follow the valleys and curve around obstacles. In this image, stream lines are diverted or curve around the mesas. <br/> <br/> The mesas in this image are also surrounded by aprons of debris that appear to have flowed away from the mesa.

In the center of the image lies an impact crater about 130 meters across (425 feet). Craters on the polar deposits are rare because the very active surface processes remove them quickly. This particular crater is likely to have been formed less than 100,000 years ago, which is very recent in geologic terms. Streaks of material emanating from the crater rim have been created as the ice and dust being transported across the surface by the wind encounters that obstacle. <br/> <br/> Although its initial depth was probably about 25 m (80 ft), the crater has been infilled with ice and dust and is now quite shallow. However, in one portion of the crater (lower right), the fill material has been removed, creating a pit adjacent to the crater wall. This pit contains a fresh deposit of ice and may be in the beginning stages of being infilled again. These cycles of infilling and erosion will eventually erase the crater from the landscape. <br/> <br/> Scientists can examine many of these craters at different stages in their lifespan, from the very fresh to the almost erased. Using these data we can make estimates of how active this part of the martian surface is today. Of course we need to find these rare craters first!

This is a large area with abundant sedimentary rocks forming a stack hundreds of meters thick, and now being eroded into a landscape reminiscent of the southwestern United States. <br/> <br/> The timescale involved in depositing and eroding these layers is evident from the remnant impact craters preserved here. The large arc in the image is the rim of one crater; the smaller, circular dark spots are traces of other impacts. Light sediments are found both inside and outside the large crater, indicating that this crater formed during the period of sediment deposition. It is likely that this depression, which was probably more than a kilometer deep when it formed, was completely filled and buried and is now being exhumed. Crater densities are often used to estimate the age of surfaces on Mars, but here the rate of erosion is enough to erase small craters, reducing the apparent age of the surface. These rocks probably date from an early era of Martian history, but no fresh, pristine craters are visible. <br/> <br/> The smaller circular patches are also impact craters seen somewhere in a complex cycle of burial and erosion. They are filled with dark material which probably mantled the region at one point, most likely after all of the light material was deposited. In some places this appears to have been hardened into rock, as in the large dark circle in the north-central part of the image. Material eroded from this hardened mantle may now be forming the ripples seen in many places as it is blown by the wind; the color of the ripples is similar to the slabs of dark mantle. <br/> <br/> At the finest scale, the light sediments are intricately textured. A diverse assortment of fine cracks called joints are visible. The scale and density of these joints varies across the image; this suggests variations in the properties of the rocks. Although the image as a whole is a relatively flat plain, at small scale the surface is intricately rough. The balance between erosion and rock strength has left a surface with many small knobs, mesas, cliffs, and bumpy textures. <br/> <br/> Further evidence for the diversity of rocks here comes from the enhanced color. The dark mantling materials are generally blue in the RGB color image while the sediments are generally pale, but a diverse range of hues indicates variations in the composition (or in the amount of sand and dust trapped on the surface by textures of varying roughness).

The ejecta blanket is composed of materials which are resistant to erosion and coat surface material around the crater causing it to erode more slowly than the rest of the region. Eventually, erosion of the topmost layers of the surrounding plains cause the crater and ejecta to appear as if standing upon a raised platform or pedestal. Features such as this on Mars are called pedestal craters. In this example, the eroding ejecta has ragged edges with some detached mesas and buttes and resistant layers in the ejecta are forming steep and overhanging cliffs. <br/> <br/> Emerging from the rock beneath the pedestal crater is an inverted flat-topped channel. Similar to the pedestal craters, inverted channels occur when former channel depressions become elevated because materials that fill the depressions are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding terrain. For example, a depression may become filled with lava that is more resistant to erosion than the surrounding surface, or gravel or boulders transported in a high energy flow that protect underlying material from erosion, or sediments deposited by a flowing stream that have become cemented. <br/> <br/> In this image, the pedestal crater superposes the flat-topped ridge indicating that it is younger and formed after the channel. Therefore the channel formed first, possibly a result of water flowing on the surface. Resistant materials were deposited on the flat channel floor and the channel was later filled and buried by sediments. <br/> <br/> Even later, a meteorite impacted the surface of sediments above the channel forming a crater and ejecta blanket of resistant materials that protected underlying materials from being blown away and eroded. Over time, the topmost layers of the surrounding plains eroded due to winds or climate change or other factors leaving the crater and ejecta raised above the surrounding surface. Continued erosion also eventually exhumed and inverted the flat-topped channel in the rock layers beneath the crater. <br/> <br/> Written by: Maria Banks   (28 January 2009) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010829_1880\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010829_1880</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010829_1880", "id": 573, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_010829_1880.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/573/", "slug": "flat-topped-sinuous-ridge-contacting-pedestal-crat", "title": "Flat-Topped Sinuous Ridge Contacting Pedestal Crater"}, {"content": "A valley extends across the center of the image, and a tributary joins it from the north, while another branch connects from the south.

For instance, polygonal fracture patterns commonly occur in ice-rich ground on both Earth and Mars. Similar textures occur in many parts of the Martian mid-latitudes and indicate past processes which have reworked much of the surface. <br/> <br/> Written by: Colin Dundas   (14 January 2009) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009824_2190\" title=\"PSP_009824_2190\">   PSP_009824_2190  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010536_2190\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010536_2190</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010536_2190", "id": 581, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_010536_2190.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/581/", "slug": "strange-surfaces-in-nilosyrtis-region", "title": "Strange Surfaces in Nilosyrtis Region"}, {"content": "Sand dunes are found in numerous locales on Mars.

How gullies formed remains elusive, although several hypothesis have been offered.  The main problem is that liquid water is not stable on the surface of Mars due to the present-day pressure and temperatures. Some possible gully hypotheses are that they are the result of a fluid (carbon dioxide or water), or they may instead be the result of dry debris flows. <br/> <br/> The gullies in this image source from a similar distance from the crater rim and terminate down the slope in relatively bright deposits. They also have debris free alcoves and exhibit other features typically formed by water flow including a sinuous channel shape, channels that merge and split forming a braided pattern, and channels that extend out onto the debris fan deposits. <br/> <br/> One possible hypothesis for the origin of these gullies is that the similar elevation of the gully sources below the crater rim may indicate that groundwater flowed out of the crater wall along a subsurface rock or soil layer. Salts and minerals in the groundwater may have allowed the water to continue flowing on the surface longer as a liquid.

Several long, sinuous, and branching ridges have been exposed by wind erosion. Raised curvilinear ridges observed in this region, such as those shown here, are believed to be former stream channels now preserved in inverted relief. <br/> <br/> On Earth, inverted relief occurs when formerly low-lying areas become elevated because the original depression is filled with materials, such as lava, that are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding terrain. In the case of stream channels, the stream bed may contain larger rocks and/or sediments that have been cemented by chemicals precipitating from flowing water, which remain while adjacent fine material is blown away by the wind. In this location, it is most likely that water once flowed through this channel and deposited sediments that eventually filled the channel and became cemented. Over time, wind eroded the surrounding surface leaving the remnant channels exposed as raised curvilinear ridges. <br/> <br/> Surrounding the inverted channels are several shorter, linear, streamlined ridges oriented roughly south/north. These are yardangs or streamlined remnants of material shaped by the action of sand-blown sediments that eroded away weaker material. The orientation of the yardangs indicates the primary wind direction. Landforms such as these are common in desert areas on Earth. Portions of the larger curvilinear ridges appear to be eroding into yardangs. <br/> <br/> Written by: Maria Banks   (14 January 2009) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010533_1755\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010533_1755</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010533_1755", "id": 584, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_010533_1755.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/584/", "slug": "raised-curvilinear-ridges-in-aeolis-mensae", "title": "Raised Curvilinear Ridges in Aeolis Mensae"}, {"content": "This is the most recent of a series of images within the expected landing ellipse of the Beagle 2 lander, lost in late 2003. <br/> <br/> We hope that someone will take the time to view the entire image at full resolution to search for any unusual small features that might have resulted from the landing attempt.

The material between the branched ridges has a fracture pattern and color similar to deposits elsewhere on Mars that are known to be rich in hydrated minerals such as clays. <br/> <br/> The inverted channels have short, stubby branches characteristic of formation by groundwater sapping. Spring water seeps into the channels and undercuts overlying layers which collapse, so the channels grow headward.  These images tell the story of an ancient wet environment on Mars, where life could have been possible. Ancient Martian life was most likely to consist of microorganisms rather than giant tree ferns. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen   (29 April 2009) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_012725_2015\" title=\"ESP_012725_2015\">   ESP_012725_2015  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_012435_2015\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_012435_2015</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_012435_2015", "id": 600, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_012435_2015.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/600/", "slug": "branched-features-on-the-floor-of-antoniadi-crater", "title": "Branched Features on the Floor of Antoniadi Crater"}, {"content": "HiRISE has examined many possible landing sites for the Mars Science Laboratory rover, including the area visible here. <br/> <br/> The rover is schedule to launch in 2011, and will perform a precision landing on the Red Planet.

This leaves structurally weak areas that have a greater chance of collapsing when the area (lava tubes or magma chamber) no longer contains molten lava or is drained from the chamber. <br/> <br/> There is evidence that Mars is not the only planet that has features like these. Earth also has similar pit chains that have formed in Iceland. This chain was formed on a known fault line and the pits formed when the region experienced an earthquake. <br/> <br/> This process may be similar to the way the Martian pit chains were formed. If \"Marsquakes\" are the cause of the formation of pit chains, this will support the idea that there is still geologic (tectonic) activity occurring on Mars. The pit chains that have been found on Earth are considerably smaller than similar features that are found on Mars. Earth's are smaller due to higher gravity and weathering makes them smaller and at some point completely erasing them from sight.

We are also trying to help understand why some missions were not successful. <br/> <br/> One such mission was the Mars Polar Lander which went permanently silent after entering the Martian atmosphere in December 1999. It is speculated that the landing sequence failed when the legs were deployed and accidentally reported that the lander was on the ground. As a consequence, the parachute was cut while the lander was actually hundreds of feet in the air. <br/> <br/> This HiRISE image is one of a sequence searching for either the parachute or the crumpled lander on the ground.

It is thought that these have been carved by vaporized ice. On Mars, the ice goes straight to a gas  (a process called \"sublimation\") rather than first melting.  So, as the ice heats in the spring and summer, gas is generated and flows under the remaining ice.

The boulders in this image range in size from approximately 1 to 6 meters (20 feet). <br/> <br/> Other craters in the region around this HiRISE image have a similar appearance (heavily modified with boulder-rich floors) as seen <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://viewer.mars.asu.edu/planetview/inst/ctx/B09_013249_1272_XN_52S191W\">  <strong>   in this CTX image  </strong> </a> which covers this crater imaged by HiRISE, as well as a crater directly to the north.

Like Earth, Mars has concentrations of water ice at both poles. <br/> <br/> Because Mars is so much colder, however, the seasonal ice that gets deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring (generally analogous to winter-time snow on Earth) is actually carbon dioxide ice. Around the south pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter. This persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south polar residual cap, and is what we are looking at in this HiRISE image. <br/> <br/> Relatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by semi-circular depressions and linear, branching troughs that make a pattern resembling those of your fingerprints. The high-standing areas are thicknesses of several meters of carbon dioxide ice. The depressions and troughs are thought to be caused by the removal of carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). HiRISE is observing this carbon dioxide terrain to try to determine how these patterns develop and how fast the depressions and troughs grow. <br/> <br/> While the south polar residual cap as a whole is present every year, there are certainly changes taking place within it. With the high resolution of HiRISE, we intend to measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over multiple Mars years. Knowing the amount of carbon dioxide removed can give us an idea of the atmospheric, weather, and climate conditions over the course of a year. <br/> <br/> In addition, looking for where carbon dioxide ice might be being deposited on top of this terrain may help us understand if there is any net loss or accumulation of the carbon-dioxide ice over time, which would be a good indicator of whether Mars' climate is in the process of changing or not. <br/> <br/> Written by: Patrick Russell   (18 November 2009) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014261_0930\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014261_0930</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014261_0930", "id": 665, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_014261_0930.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/665/", "slug": "south-polar-carbon-dioxide-ice-cap", "title": "South Polar Carbon Dioxide Ice Cap"}, {"content": "Impact craters on Mars are kind of neat: many of them look very different than impact craters seen on the Moon or Mercury. <br/> <br/> Fresh lunar and Mercurian craters have ejecta blankets that look a bit rough near the crater rims; around larger craters, long rays or chains of secondary craters radiate away from the crater rims. Some Martian craters are similar to these craters, but Mars also has a high proportion of craters with forms not found on the Moon or Mercury: rampart craters. <br/> <br/> Rampart craters, also called fluidized-ejecta craters, have ejecta blankets that appear lobate, or rounded, and end in low ridges or ramparts, such as the ridge in this HiRISE image. Here you see the rampart at the edge of the ejecta blanket that comes from an approximately 16 kilometer (10 mile)-diameter crater, about 16 km (10 mi) to the east. <br/> <br/> For years there has been a debate about whether these lobes and ramparts were formed by ejecta interacting with the thin Martian atmosphere, or whether they formed because volatiles (such as water or ice) in the subsurface were incorporated into the ejecta material excavated by the impact.

Because the sun is always low in the sky at this latitude, the steep walls of the pits receive more solar energy than the high-standing, flat areas between the pits.

Impact craters that form here experience slightly different processes of modification and degradation than those that form in rocky areas. <br/> <br/> One example of such a process is sublimation. Most of the material that makes up an icy crater is volatile, meaning it can melt or sublimate (change directly from a solid to a gas) if heated. Sublimation is more common on Mars because of its thin, dry atmosphere. Crater walls facing the Sun receive more direct light than their surroundings, and are therefore more easily warmed. If the ice in the walls sublimates, the rim structure of the crater becomes degraded. <br/> <br/> The impact crater in this image is roughly 900 meters (a little over 0.5 mile) across. The remaining raised rim of the crater is illuminated from the bottom right of the image, causing preferential heating of the interior of the rim structure. The ice appears thin here (more brown material is exposed), with an even thinner cover on the remaining exterior rim. This could be caused by a number of possibilities: perhaps the exterior wall is steeper than the interior wall, resulting in more direct exposure to sunlight, causing more efficient sublimation when the Sun shines on that wall. <br/> <br/> Once ice begins to melt, darker dustier material is exposed. The darker material absorbs more heat than white ice (just like standing in the Sun wearing a black shirt makes you warmer than wearing a white shirt, which reflects the Sun's light), causing more and more ice to sublimate near the dark material.

Breccia is a mixture of chunks of rock (clasts) that have been broken by an energetic geologic event, such as a landslide or crater-forming impact, that are then cemented together in a finer grained material. Megabreccia features very large clasts that are big enough for HiRISE to see on the surface - some even larger than 30 feet across. In this 200 meter (about 1/8 of a mile) diameter exposure of megabreccia, clasts of various colors (indicating different kinds of rocks) and sizes have been exposed in the uplifted central peak of Toro Crater. <br/> <br/> Scientists think that megabreccia may have formed early in Mars' history during a period of frequent impact crater formation. These early rocks were then covered by younger rock layers. HiRISE frequently targets the central peaks of craters, because these features tend to bring up rocks like these megabreccia that are usually buried under the surface. <br/> <br/> So far, HiRISE has found megabreccia in more than a hundred places on Mars. In many of these locations, CRISM has identified clays in the material cementing the clasts together, providing yet another motivation for the study of megabreccia. <br/> <br/> HiRISE first imaged Toro Crater (in <a href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005842_1970\">  PSP_005842_1970 </a> ) because <a href=\"http://crism.jhuapl.edu/\">  CRISM </a> detected hydrated minerals, like clays, on the floor.

Data from the <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/\">  <strong>   Mars Orbiter Camera  </strong> </a> (MOC) on the (now defunct) Mars Global Surveyor, the <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/\">  <strong>   Context Camera  </strong> </a> (CTX) on MRO, and HiRISE have dated craters to within a few years or even months, based on repeat images that show no craters in the earlier image and craters present in the later image. <br/> <br/> Most of the new craters identified by CTX and HiRISE have been located in Mars' dustiest areas, where a new impact will scour dust from the surface and reveal darker underlying rock. This color difference makes the craters easier to spot. Other, less dusty areas of Mars are certainly being bombarded as well, but the size of the craters makes them difficult to detect without stark color contrasts. Once a new dark spot has been identified by CTX, HiRISE will take a follow-up image to confirm that the dark spots are in fact impact craters. <br/> <br/> Many of the newest craters are part of a crater cluster, <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/details/cut/PSP_010200_1805_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   like this one  </strong> </a> .

Located along the southern boundary of the Thaumasia Plateau in the southern highlands, images of these valley systems are often used in textbooks or online as evidence for a more Earth-like climate on early Mars. <br/> <br/> At least before the HiRISE era, whenever a single image illustrating \"water on Mars\" was needed, a Viking-era image of Warrego answered the call. Despite its fame, the origin of the Warrego valley networks has never been fully understood. <br/> <br/> At first glance, these ancient (several billion years old) valley systems seem similar to erosional networks on Earth, but they are simpler and not as finely integrated. In addition, they are only located in one area on the plateau boundary. Valleys have not formed all along the plateau boundary as might be expected from rainfall (Gulick, 2001, Geomorphology, pgs. 241-268). Nevertheless many have argued that these features attest to an ancient warmer, wetter time of Mars' geological history.To better understand the Warrego valleys, HiRISE imaged the headwater regions of one of the tributaries. <br/> <br/> Seen at high resolution the system appears more complex than implied by the much lower resolution Viking-era images.  The valley floor—as well as the floors of nearby small craters—is covered by an enigmatic rough, angular, blocky textured material that seems to be contained in a finer-grained material. This rough textured material might also be the result of ice evaporating from the subsurface. <br/> <br/> At any rate at HiRISE resolution, there is little sign of fluvial bedforms, like channel bars, from the original erosive event that carved the valleys. Given the age of these valleys, clues to its origin may long since have been obscured by subsequent geologic processes. Without such geologic clues we can add little more to the previous speculation about what might have carved these features originally. In this case, the high resolution images provided by HiRISE inform us that we have much more to learn about some of the best known landforms on Mars. <br/> <br/> Written by: Virginia Gulick   (6 January 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003633_1385\" title=\"PSP_003633_1385\">   PSP_003633_1385  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004266_1385\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004266_1385</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004266_1385", "id": 688, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/PSP_004266_1385.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/688/", "slug": "headwater-region-of-warrego-valles", "title": "Headwater Region of Warrego Valles"}, {"content": "This image covers part of the Northwest rim of Hale Crater.

Investigations propose the most likely cause of the mission failure is that the spacecrafts computers misinterpreted the release of the landers legs in preparation for descent as touch-down on the Martian surface, causing descent engines to shut off when the lander was still 40 meters (130 feet) above ground.

Because the central uplifts of complex craters expose rocks and materials that originated deep below the surface, researchers can use these regions as possible \"windows\" to view the rocks beneath the surface. <br/> <br/> A northeast-southwest linear valley or trough transects this region dividing the uplift in two.  This valley, or lineation, may have resulted from processes occurring during the uplift event or subsequent to crater formation. When seen at HiRISE resolution the center of this valley seems to bisect what may be a small (less than a kilometer wide) central pit. <br/> Written by: Shawn D.

Imagine if one of the Martian rovers had been at this spot when this object blasted into the surface! This may be a very small crater on planetary scales, but it could still cause a lot of damage. On the Moon, where there is no atmosphere to provide protection from even the tiniest micrometeorite, the danger would be even higher.

Repeat images of this site have been acquired to study aeolian (wind-related) changes on the surface. <br/> <br/> This image was acquired in February 2010, six months after the most recent prior image ( <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014277_1650\">  <strong>   ESP_014277_1650  </strong> </a> ) and seven months after the most recent color image ( <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_013921_1650\">  <strong>   ESP_013921_1650  </strong> </a> ) of Spirit's location. During the intervening time, a significant regional dust storm blanketed Gusev crater, and bright Martian dust subsequently settled onto the surface. The surface around the Columbia Hills therefore appears brighter in this new image. However, numerous dark streaks are superposed on this surface; these are probably tracks left by dust devils migrating across the Gusev plains. <br/> <br/> While driving around the \"Home Plate\" feature in the Columbia Hills, Spirit's wheels have excavated bright soils that were previously buried several centimeters beneath the Martian surface. These soils contain minerals such as sulfates and opaline silica that suggest past water activity at this location. The excavated soils are visible from orbit in previous HiRISE color images, where they appear as small, bright, blue-toned patches. These patches are all virtually invisible in the new HiRISE image, suggesting that the soils may have been buried by dust settling during the past few months. <br/> <br/> Combining these orbital images with those taken by Spirit on the Martian surface provides a view of aeolian surface changes at a range of scales. <br/> <br/> Written by: James Wray   (7 April 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016677_1650\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016677_1650</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016677_1650", "id": 708, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_016677_1650.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/708/", "slug": "monitor-spirit-landing-site-for-aeolian-changes", "title": "Monitor Spirit Landing Site for Aeolian Changes"}, {"content": "This HiRISE image shows at least three <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016423_2640_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   isolated clouds  </strong> </a> of particles near a steep cliff in the northern polar region of Mars. <br/> <br/> These clouds, rolling or hovering close to the ground yet reaching up tens of meters high (up to 180 feet), are likely the result of an avalanche or fall of mostly carbon-dioxide frost. The frost clings to the scarp in the darkness of winter and may be disrupted by sunlight and thermal processes with the coming of spring. The cliff, approximately 700 meters (2000 feet) high is made up of layers of water ice with varying dust content, roughly similar to the polar ice caps on Earth. <br/> <br/> On top is bright white carbon-dioxide ice and frost. Last year, HiRISE was monitoring this area for changes in frost patterns as spring progressed - it was quite surprising and very exciting to find an avalanche in progress (e.g. <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007338_2640\">  <strong>   PSP_007338_2640  </strong> </a> )! This year, we were ready to capture more. <br/> <br/> Targeting this scarp as well as others around the edge of the north polar icy layered deposits will help determine if this process is a characteristic one in Mars' cycle of seasons, including the period of year it is active and how wide-spread around the region it is. Several such events occurred earlier this year at this same scarp (e.g. <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016173_2640\">  <strong>   ESP_016173_2640  </strong> </a> ), and several more were also seen at a few other scarps (e.g. <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016228_2650\">  <strong>   ESP_016228_2650  </strong> </a> ) spread around about one-third of the circumference of the polar region. <br/> <br/> Looking at all of the individual instances of avalanches from all of the images will also allow us to piece together a sequence of snaphots of the whole avalanche process, from beginning (a stream of material falling down the cliff face) to end (lingering puffy clouds). Based on this year's observations, these events happen mostly in the middle of spring, roughly equivalent to April to early May on Earth. And, they are indeed more widespread than just this one scarp. All together, it seems this is a regular spring process at Mars' north pole that may be expected every year - avalanche season! This information, in conjunction with the results of numerical modeling of the behavior of the materials involved, will help us find out what is causing these dramatic events. <br/> <br/> Written by: Patrick Russell   (7 April 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016423_2640\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016423_2640</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016423_2640", "id": 709, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_016423_2640.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/709/", "slug": "avalanche-clouds", "title": "Avalanche Clouds"}, {"content": "This image shows a new impact crater that formed on Mars between May 2002 and February 2004.

Later the ice sheet can be buried by new ice layers and grow in size again; it's likely that many of these cycles have occurred over the ice sheet's history. <br/> <br/> The Martian North polar layered deposits are an ice sheet much like the Greenland ice sheet on the Earth. Just as with the ice sheet in Greenland,  this Martian ice sheet contains many layers that record variations in the Martian climate. <br/> <br/> These sorts of fluctuations in the thickness of the ice sheet are most pronounced at the edges of the sheet where this HiRISE image was taken. The ice sheet ends here in a gentle scarp that slopes about eight degrees downhill from bottom to top in this image. The layering within the ice is exposed on this sloping surface; the thickness of the ice here is about 1 kilometer (about 3300 feet). Scientists are analyzing these layers to see what information they might hold regarding previous Martian climates. <br/> <br/> Most of the layers are parallel to each other.  However, <a href=\"http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_016900_016999/ESP_016973_2595/ESP_016973_2595_RED.NOMAP.browse.jpg\">  <strong>   if you look more closely at the layers near the base of the slope  </strong> </a> then you can see that they are orientated at odd angles to each other.  This happens when the ice sheet undergoes the fluctuations in thickness described above. Ice is ablated away and the new ice sheet surface cuts at an angle through several layers. When ice starts being laid down here again, it is in layers parallel to the surface and so at an angle to the older layers. Much later this sloping surface was created by erosion and gives us a cross-sectional view of all the layers and the angles they make with each other. When sloping layers are truncated by flat ones like this geologists call it an angular unconformity. <br/> <br/> This location is especially interesting because the ice sheet partly covers an impact crater that is about 17 kilometers (about 10 miles) diameter. You can see the rim of this crater on the flat terrain in the top quarter of the image. The curving crater rim is partly buried by the ice sheet here.  The slopes within the crater caused the lowest elevation ice layers to be tilted and probably led to the abundance of angular unconformities at this location. <br/> <br/> Written by: Shane Byrne   (31 March 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016973_2595\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016973_2595</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016973_2595", "id": 717, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_016973_2595.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/717/", "slug": "icy-layers-and-climate-fluctuations-at-the-martian", "title": "Icy Layers and Climate Fluctuations at the Martian North Pole"}, {"content": "<a href=\"http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_016800_016899/ESP_016886_2030/ESP_016886_2030_RED.abrowse.jpg\">  <strong>   This image covers the northern edge  </strong> </a> of the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.

The hard layers are lava and the soft layers may be dust (from large dust storms) or volcanic ash. <br/> <br/> This HiRISE image also shows a large tongue of material that has flowed over the giant cliff.  While superficially similar to lava flows, this flow is actually a landslide. Most scientists think the the cliffs also formed by landslides, just much bigger ones.

What formed this hill? Could it be a volcano?  That was hypothesized to be the case in a paper published in 2001, and this suggestion was entered to test that idea, perhaps from seeing internal layering exposed by the crater.  <br/>  <br/>  This is an example of what we regard as an excellent science justification—following up on a testable hypothesis with specific observational goals. It was entered by blogospherian Emily Lakdawalla of the Planetary Society. If you're thinking we chose to acquire this image early because we want her to blog nice things about HiRISE and HiWiSH, you're right! But its also a good suggestion.  <br/>  <br/>  So what does the HiRISE image show us? Mostly it shows a dust mantle, hiding the bedrock it was intended to study. The dustiness is especially apparent from the uniformity of the color data. Much of Mars is covered by dust, so we often favor the relatively dust-free patches for HiRISE imaging. (You can usually tell whether a surface is dusty by looking at  <a href=\"http://www.mars.asu.edu/data/\">   <strong>    dust index maps   </strong>  </a>  and the THEMIS nighttime IR mosaic.) We hope to get the nighttime IR map entered as a layer of HiWISH to help image suggesters.  <br/>  <br/>  The night-IR bright (warm) stuff is rocky or sandy, and dark (cool) stuff is probably dusty. Dust cools off rapidly at night while rocks store and slowly release heat. If the dust is thin, HiRISE images can still show the underlying meter-scale morphology. Maybe someone will want to study the dust-related processes on Mars, which are actually not well understood. Additionally, dusty surfaces are where we can find new impact craters that disturb the dust and make easy-to-see dark spots.  We'll see if Emily finds something interesting in this image.  <br/>  Written by: Alfred McEwen   (31 March 2010)  <br/> </a> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016954_1590\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016954_1590</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016954_1590", "id": 719, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_016954_1590.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/719/", "slug": "dust-mantled-topography-near-zephyria-tholus", "title": "Dust-Mantled Topography Near Zephyria Tholus"}, {"content": "This approximately 20 kilometer diameter impact crater is located just to the south of Coprates Chasma in Valles Marineris. <br/> <br/> Near the center of the crater are some light-toned rocks.

The ground seems to have been soft and \"squishy\" when it was hit by the meteorite. This in itself is not that unusual for Mars. In many locations the material thrown out from impact craters appears to have flowed like mud. It is generally agreed that this is because there was a lot of ice in the ground and this ice was melted by the energy of the impact, producing a large amount of mud. <br/> <br/> However, in this area, the ejecta seems to have largely vaporized. More puzzling is the way that the crater appears to have collapsed into itself. It appears that there are some hard layers near the surface and then soft material that melts or vaporizes underneath. Indeed, HiRISE reveals a lot of rocky boulders associated with the hard layers. <br/> <br/> One possibility is that this region had a thick layer of relatively pure water ice protected by a thin, hard, layer of boulders. So the impact punched through the hard coating, and both the ejecta and the center of the crater essentially evaporated into the atmosphere.

The faults are seen to cut the circular rim of the impact crater. Also, the impact did not destroy the adjacent faults. These observations tell us that the fault was active after the impact occurred. <br/> <br/> In addition, by measuring the distance of offset of the different pieces of the crater rim separated by the fault line (assuming that when the crater formed, the rim was continuous around its circumference), the amount of movement along the fault can be estimated, laterally and vertically. Faults like these cause troughs to form, called graben, of which the heavily shadowed one is a good example. The center (shadowed) section has been dropped downwards relative to the surrounding terrain, forming the trough. <br/> <br/> It is also clear that parts of the crater rim are lower than others where the graben intersects the crater. The sides of the graben (the faults forming the walls of the trough) are sloped, so that the dropped-down part of the crater rim has also moved horizontally away from the higher part of the rim. The combined down-dropping and moving apart indicates that the land here is being stretched and pulled apart, called extension. By measuring the amount of offset on all the faults, we can estimate how much extension has occurred in this part of the planet. <br/> <br/> This location is especially helpful because, as mentioned above, we have a good knowledge of the before-faulting configuration of the land, in which the crater rim was continuous. Finally, it is interesting that there is no sign of the fault on the floor of the crater  the floor has not been faulted and no part is down-dropped and stretched apart as the crater rim has been. This indicates that some infilling of the crater (perhaps by lava or airborne sediment) has likely occurred since the fault was active, burying the trace of the fault and representing a third stage of geologic history in this area. <br/> <br/> Written by: Patrick Russell   (16 June 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017399_2185\" title=\"ESP_017399_2185\">   ESP_017399_2185  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017900_2185\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017900_2185</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_017900_2185", "id": 739, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_017900_2185.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/739/", "slug": "impact-crater-cut-by-faults", "title": "Impact Crater Cut by Faults"}, {"content": "This image is taken of an interesting linear feature in the Aeolis and Zephyria regions.

The origins of these gullies have been the subject of much debate; they could have formed by flowing water, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry granular flows. The orientation of these gullies is of interest because many craters only contain gullies on certain walls, such as those that are pole-facing. This could be due to changes in orbital conditions and differences in solar heating along specific walls. <br/> <br/> Many of the other features observed in and around this crater however are indicative of an ice-rich terrain, which may lend credence to the water formation hypothesis, at least for the gullies visible here. The most notable of these features is the \"scalloped\" terrain in and around the crater. This type of terrain has been interpreted as a sign of surface caving, perhaps due to sublimation of underlying ice. (Sublimation is the process of a solid changing directly to a gas.) <br/> <br/> Another sign of ice is the presence of parallel lineations and pitted material on the floor of the crater, similar to what is referred to as concentric crater fill. Parallel linear cracks are also observed along the crater wall over the gullies, which could be due to thermal contraction of ice-rich material. <br/> <br/> All of these features taken together are evidence for ice-rich material having been deposited in this region during different climatic conditions that has subsequently begun to melt and/or sublimate under current conditions.

So, what happens to all those lava flows running off of Olympus Mons? <br/> <br/> This observation shows that they are buried by yet younger \"flood\" lavas that lap up against the side of Olympus Mons. In this image we see two very different types of Olympus Mons lava flows. On the West, there is a thick flow with a rough surface texture. This is almost assuredly similar to lava flows in Hawaii that are called \"aa.\" The lava is quite sticky as it flows and thus is ripped into chunks when it tries to move. Next to the aa flow is a long trough or channel. If you look closely, you can see tongues of lava flowing to either side of the channel. This looks like the product of a long eruption with lots of pulses. <br/> <br/> The channel eventually disappears and an irregular set of pits is visible at its extension. This is probably because the channel had developed a solid roof (becoming a lava tube) and then lava burst out of the tube. This kind of complex evolution of a lava flow can be seen on Kilauea Volcano, in Hawaii, today.

First, individual layers have different surface textures. Some scientists think that changing surface textures reflect changing physical properties (such as dust content or ice grain size) of the underlying layer, and looking for patterns in the sequence of layer textures can tell us about patterns in the climate in which a layer formed. <br/> <br/> Second, there are several unconformities, or places where one layer is interrupted and overlain by another layer.  These unconformities are due to periods where layers were eroded or removed, followed by times when new layers were deposited. Mapping the locations of unconformities can tell us how the deposit shrank and grew over time, and tell us where large changes in climate occurred, causing water ice to be removed from the polar regions. <br/> <br/> Finally, the dark and bright streaks are due to recent winds blowing surface frost around, and can tell us about wind patterns in the current polar climate. <br/> <br/> Written by: Sarah Milkovich   (4 August 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_018482_2790\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_018482_2790</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_018482_2790", "id": 757, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_018482_2790.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/757/", "slug": "climate-change-recorded-within-north-polar-layers", "title": "Climate Change Recorded within North Polar Layers"}, {"content": "This HiRISE image shows a large ice mound located in Louth Crater.

There are some specific places, however, where liquid water may have been stable later in the planet's history, when Mars is considered to have been cold and dry. Lyot Crater is one of those places. <br/> <br/> Lyot Crater is a \"peak-ring basin\" that formed in the lowlands of the Northern hemisphere of Mars, making it the lowest topographic point in the northern hemisphere. Additionally, we know that the Lyot impact event occurred after the most significant era of fluvial activity on Mars, so any features observed in Lyot were formed after that era as well. <br/> <br/> This observation shows what appears to be a very unusual fan of material that is sourced by a valley that extends upslope for almost 50 kilometers along the floor of Lyot Crater (top-right of the full image). The fan is not fresh, so this activity pre-dates the martian gullies (a few of which can be seen at the top of this image). The fan has been mantled by smooth material which has been removed in some areas and fractured in others. This makes it difficult to tell what the fan looked like when it was originally emplaced. <br/> <br/> Lyot Crater is found in a region of Mars that is thought to host many debris-covered glaciers (some of which are found within Lyot itself) and ice-rich mantling units.

High resolution imaging by HiRISE in November 2008 ( <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2010/details/cut/ESP_019482_2135_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   left panel of the subimage  </strong> </a> ) confirmed that the dark spot was ejecta from a cluster of craters. <br/> <br/> Three large craters ranging from 3 to 5 meters diameter and at least 5 smaller craters make up the cluster pictured. A smaller outlier (approximately 2 meters in diameter, not pictured in the subimage) landed 300 meters away to the Northwest (bottom right in the non-map projected subimages). These craters were likely produced by a single impactor that broke into pieces as it fell through the Martian atmosphere. <br/> <br/> The impactor probably approached from the Northwest, judging from the shape of the ejecta pattern and the location of the small outlier. The impacts sprayed the site with dark ejecta excavated from beneath the bright surface. The conspicuous, newly formed feature provides an ideal location to monitor the effects of wind on the modern Martian surface. <br/> <br/> HiRISE imaged the site again in September 2010 (right panel of the subimage), after the passage of a full Martian year when the illumination was similar to the previous HiRISE image. By luck, the incidence angle (the zenith angle of the Sun) of the later image was only 0.2 degrees different from that of the earlier image. However, the phase angle (the angle between the Sun, the target, and the camera) was smaller by about 14 degrees as the spacecraft rolled in the opposite direction. <br/> <br/> The new picture shows the ejecta pattern apparently faded in comparison to the previous image. The contrast of other features in the scene (such as the hills and boulders at the bottom of the cutout) is similar, but the ejecta from the crater cluster is noticeably brighter in the HiRISE image from 2010. One possibility is that the dark ejecta reflects sunlight differently than the bright surrounding terrain, becoming darker more rapidly as phase angle increases. Another possibility is that the ejecta pattern was mantled by a thin layer of bright dust that settled out of the atmosphere during the 20 month interval between the two images. Further monitoring of this site by HiRISE will help choose between these hypotheses. <br/> <br/> This target illustrates how the various instruments on MRO work together. The spatial coverage of HiRISE is too limited to search for new impact craters across the Martian globe. Yet the spatial resolution of HiRISE can be used to verify and study details in sites identified as suspicious by CTX. The complimentary capabilities of the MRO instruments provide a fuller understanding of Mars together than their insights taken separately. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler   (3 November 2010) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019482_2135\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019482_2135</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019482_2135", "id": 766, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_019482_2135.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/766/", "slug": "fading-impact-crater", "title": "Fading Impact Crater"}, {"content": "This image was suggested by Dennis Mitchell's seventh grade Mars student team at Evergreen Middle School in Cottonwood, California  as part of the HiRISE Quest Student Imaging Challenge. <br/> <br/> The students discovered this dark pit feature in a THEMIS image and submitted a HiRISE image suggestion to see a close-up of this feature and determine whether it might be a possible skylight cave. <br/> <br/> This image is located on the southeastern flank of Pavonis Mons, a large volcano located in the Tharsis Region of Mars.

The dark rings seen within the concentric structures appear rougher than their surroundings. The bright material in which they formed is densely fractured, suggesting that it is quite brittle. Several small impact craters found within the bright unit produced sprays of dark ejecta, suggesting that the bright surface layer may be only a few meters thick.

The circular structures within the flow could have formed by desiccation, as the sediments dried out and contracted, similar to mud cracks but on a much larger scale. Or they may have formed by a process of diapirism, if a solid crust formed on the surface of the drying sediments that was denser than the water-saturated slurry below. On Earth, slurries of sand and water that are pressurized by the weight of the overburden can rise to the surface to form \"injectites,\" eruptions of sand and water that can reach heights of hundreds of meters.

Scientists are analyzing many images like this in order to try and answer the broader question of whether liquid water is responsible for the these gullies or not. <br/> <br/> Written by: Shane Byrne   (22 September 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_018809_2495\" title=\"ESP_018809_2495\">   ESP_018809_2495  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019033_2495\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019033_2495</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019033_2495", "id": 777, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_019033_2495.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/777/", "slug": "frosted-gullies-in-the-northern-summer", "title": "Frosted Gullies in the Northern Summer"}, {"content": "The <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/all_projects/mro-ctx.php\">  <strong>   MRO Context camera  </strong> </a> team noticed a dark spot in an image taken in August 2010 that was not present in a Mars Odyssey THEMIS image taken in December 2007. <br/> <br/> The team therefore requested a full-resolution HiRISE image of the dark spot to determine whether it was caused by an impact.

The volcanic crater seen here, however, is only about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) across. This means that Tharsis was covered with volcanic activity at a wide range of scales. The wavy ridges of material seen here are solidified lava flows. <br/> <br/> On some flows, a set of narrow parallel ridges, or levees, illustrate how the flowing lava created its own path as it flowed along. Measuring the height and width of these levees and the flows themselves can yield information on the lava's rheology, or how it flowed and moved. In turn, rheology depends on the composition of the lava, among other factors. Knowing how lava moved across the surface of Mars and what it was made of can help scientists determine how similar Mars volcanic processes were to those on Earth. <br/> <br/> In order to facilitate vertical measurements from images, such as the height of these levees, the MRO spacecraft has the ability to roll to its side, allowing the HiRISE camera to take images of a spot on the surface, like these lava flows, from two different angles (on two different orbits).

Glaciers on Mars were once proposed to be likely because of the planet's cold temperatures. The global average temperature of Mars is about -68 Celsius (-90 Fahrenheit). <br/> <br/> Glacial-looking landforms are now seen to be commonplace, and even abundant in mountainous regions at higher latitudes such as here in Protonilus Mensae. These landforms are quite similar in appearance to glaciers on Earth. <br/> <br/> This image shows an example of such a landform. The mountain valley to the North (toward the bottom of the unprojected image) would be the zone of accumulation of snow and ice, which then flowed downhill (toward the top of the image) and out onto a neighboring plain. The evidence of this flow comes from the myriad of stream lines and flow fronts visible in the surface topography. Some of these topographic features may also be \"moraines,\" ridges of rock and soil debris common on the surface of glaciers and at the boundaries. <br/> <br/> Boulders up to 3 meters (9 feet) in size are visible on the surface of this feature. If you trace the streamlines from these boulders back uphill into the accumulation zone then you'll see where boulders have tumbled off the valley walls before being rafted downhill to their current location.  This process continues today even though the feature itself may not be flowing significantly anymore. <br/> <br/> Once onto the more level plain, the ice flow stalled and spread out into a bulb shaped pile where it would have gradually evaporated, called the ablation zone.\" Melting of the ice might have also occurred, though geologic evidence of melting has not yet been found. <br/> <br/> Today, Mars is very dry place, and surface ice is unstable everywhere except on the polar caps. Any ice left on the surface would evaporate without ever melting, a process called \"sublimation.\" However, past climate changes may have periodically allowed snow and ice to be stable on the Martian surface and even to build into glacial masses, hundreds of meters (yards) or more in thickness. <br/> <br/> In this image, the surface is made up of regolith (rock and soil debris) and no ice is visible. Interestingly, subsurface ice may still be present as relatively soil-free ice, which would then be called a \"debris covered glacier.\" Ice may also occur as a cement between rocky material throughout the glacial deposit and would also be capable of flowing like a glacier, which is called a \"rock glacier.\"   Alternatively, the ice may have all sublimated and what we see now is a residue of the \"glacier till,\" remnant ice-free rock and soil debris. <br/> <br/> Future stereo images of this landform will help scientists to understand the surface tilt and the forces driving ice flow under Martian gravity. In addition, stereo topography may help in estimating the thickness of the feature we see here and if any subsurface ice may still be present. <br/> <br/> Written by: Mike Mellon and Shane Byrne   (8 September 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019358_2225\" title=\"ESP_019358_2225\">   ESP_019358_2225  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_018857_2225\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_018857_2225</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_018857_2225", "id": 779, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_018857_2225.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/779/", "slug": "glacier", "title": "Glacier?"}, {"content": "This image shows portions of an alluvial fan complex in Harris Crater, an approximately 83-kilometer diameter crater located on the Northern rim of the Hellas Basin. <br/> <br/> An alluvial fan is a fan-shaped accumulation of loose, water-transported material deposited where an upland drainage emerges into a low-relief basin. In this case, two source regions on the Northern crater rim fed discrete lobe deposits that make up the alluvial fan complex. These lobes have different surface textures that enable researchers to map out the different components of the fan and investigate the sequence of fan-building processes that operated in the past. <br/> <br/> The fan surfaces have experienced erosional degradation, presumably the result of wind. One interesting result of this is the formation of \"inverted channels,\" where the former channel floors are now preserved as ridges.  Tributary channels on the alluvial fan were armored by coarse gravels or chemically cemented, making the channel bottoms resistant to erosion.   Over time, natural erosion from wind and other processes left the inverted channels elevated above the surrounding terrain. The inverted channels record the former flow direction. Differences in channel orientation point to different source regions. <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2010/details/cut/ESP_018738_1585_cut.jpg\">  <strong>   In this subimage,  </strong> </a> inverted channels from one source region are identified by black arrows, while a second flow orientation (marked by white arrows) that originated from a different source. <br/> <br/> A rugged surface texture, outlined in white, is on top of some of the inverted channels. This material is a late-stage deposit in the formation of this alluvial fan complex. The HiRISE image shows that this material is boulder-rich, which suggests the material was transported in a debris flow (a sediment-concentrated slurry of material). <br/> <br/> The preserved landforms record episodic fan formation (different portions of the fan were active at different times) resulting from different fluid flow processes.  The transition from fluvial to late-stage debris flow(s) suggests a decline in available water and/or change in sediment supply.

Typically, these polygons are several meters (yards) or more across. Mud cracks are analogous features that form when wet soil dries and contracts, but are typically form patterns only inches in scale. <br/> <br/> Mars experiences seasons and winter cooling fractures the permanently frozen ground in much the same way. As a result, polygonal patterns are wide spread throughout the middle and high latitudes. This image shows an example of such polygonal terrain. Larger impact craters, such as the 400 meter crater visible in the full image, are often muted or reduced to a remnant ring or scattered boulders, partly by infilling and mantling with wind-blown soil and dust.  Small craters that are tens of meters (yards) across are mostly absent from this terrain. This image has three maybe four such craters. These large and small crater characteristics suggests to us that this surface is young and has experienced substantial changes over geologically recent times. <br/> <br/> The polygons themselves may be partly responsible for keeping the surface “fresh.” As new polygons form over top over existing polygonal patterns they continually churn the surface by developing new troughs and mounds.

Ridges such as these can be indicative of a number of geologic processes and tells us a story of the history of this region of Mars. <br/> <br/> In some cases magma (molten rock) below the surface may fill an existing and somewhat vertical tectonic fracture, even pushing the fracture open in the process. As the magma cools, it solidifies into a tabular rock mass. This resulting cooled volcanic rock is called a \"dike.\" The new rock is often harder and more resistant to erosion than the surrounding country rock (the fractured rock of the original landscape). Later the entire region might have experience erosion from wind or water, removing weaker rocks and soils and leaving stronger rock outcrops standing. As the landscape is stripped away the harder volcanic rock remains standing as a long wall or ridge. <br/> <br/> Alternatively glaciers often contain internal rivers from melting ice that flow along their base where the ice meets the ground. These subglacial rivers can carry enormous amounts of rocks and soil sediments, depositing them along their length. When the glacier retreats it leave behind a narrow ridge of river-bed sediments that stands above the surrounding surface. In this case the ridge is called an \"esker.\" <br/> <br/> A river flowing along the surface in the absence of a glacier can produce erosion and deposition along the river bed. It can also chemically alter the river bottom, through deposition of minerals and salts that cement the soils and rocks. Later, after the river has dried up, erosion of the landscape can leave the altered river bed standing above the surrounding terrain, called an \"inverted channel.\" <br/> <br/> So what happened in Peta Crater? Analysis of this image might reveal characteristics, such as layers along the ridge walls that would indicate the ridge was deposited by flowing water. Rocks and boulders might be found eroding from the ridge, their size and shape offering clues to the strength of the ridge material; fractured and angular solid rock from a dike or loosely bound rounded boulders tumbled along a river bed. <br/> <br/> Written by: Mike Mellon   (10 November 2010) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019743_1585\" title=\"ESP_019743_1585\">   ESP_019743_1585  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019677_1585\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019677_1585</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_019677_1585", "id": 795, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_019677_1585.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/795/", "slug": "sinuous-ridges", "title": "Sinuous Ridges "}, {"content": "This image displays several nice examples of inverted channels near Juventae Chasma, part of the Valles Marineris system. <br/> <br/> Inverted topography - when a feature that ordinarily would be lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain is instead higher in elevation - forms when low-lying features are filled with erosion-resistant materials (like lava, large rocks or cemented sediments).

That doesn't seem likely, as we can see windblown deposits inside the crater, which requires at least thousands of years to form after the impact event.  Also, fresh craters with dark ejecta are common in Meridiani, and they can't all be extremely recent. <br/> <br/> Did the crater eject a subsurface layer of dark material? Maybe, but all of the bedrock exposures in the surrounding region are relatively bright. The surface layer is darker than the bedrock because dark materials like hematite concretions (\"blueberries\" found by Opportunity rover) are resistant to wind erosion and get left as a lag deposit. At HiRISE scale the rays are seen to be a thin deposit, perhaps less than 1 meter thick. <br/> <br/> The more distant ray segments contain many small secondary craters created by impact of rocks ejected from the primary crater. Maybe these are lag deposits from the original rays.  In other words, a mix of broken-up target material was deposited, but the relatively bright materials have blown away since the crater formed. The darker sand or granule-sized materials might eventually be moved by the wind and trapped inside craters, as commonly seen over Meridiani Planum, but there hasn't been sufficient time since crater formation for this process to remove the rays. <br/> <br/> The coarser particles might not be movable by wind in the current climate regime of Mars, but that changes over thousands and millions of years as Mars experiences periodic changes in orbital parameters such as tilt of the rotational axis.

Many questions remain about these relationships, and high-resolution topographic data is needed to model the processes and deduce the geologic history. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen   (9 February 2011) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020261_2010\" title=\"ESP_020261_2010\">   ESP_020261_2010  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020683_2010\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020683_2010</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020683_2010", "id": 837, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_020683_2010.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/837/", "slug": "channels-and-lava-flows-on-the-tharsis-plateau", "title": "Channels and Lava Flows on the Tharsis Plateau"}, {"content": "The Argyre impact basin contains some ancient eroded terrains, exposing rocks with diverse compositions, as shown by the color variability. <br/> <br/> These are windows into ancient Mars, which was a wetter world than Mars today. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred McEwen   (3 February 2011) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020799_1385\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020799_1385</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_020799_1385", "id": 838, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_020799_1385.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/838/", "slug": "windows-to-ancient-mars", "title": "Windows to Ancient Mars"}, {"content": "MOC and a single HiRISE image show some very interesting light-toned rocks and narrow ridges here.

This is because they are different ages.  Can you tell which is older? <br/> <br/> Sometimes you can tell something about relative ages using a geologic principle called \"superposition.\" This means that something that formed later than another feature will overlie the older feature. For example, a younger crater would have its ejecta emplaced on top of an older crater.  That particular situation is not very obvious in this image, although you might be able to see hints of it if you look closely at the high-resolution JPEG2000. <br/> <br/> There are still a few more obvious clues to their relative ages, though.  The larger crater (approximately 45 meters, or 150 feet across) is shallower relative to its size, and it has a rim that is more subdued and \"softer\" looking. It also has a distinct texture on its floor. These could be ripples or small dunes formed by air-blown dust or sand, which would require a long time to form.  The smaller crater (10 meters, 30 feet across) does not appear to have any such patterns in its floor, indicating that it is probably younger. <br/> <br/> Another clue is the dark area surrounding the smaller crater. This is an area where either lighter surface dust was removed by the impact event, or where darker ejecta was blown out of the crater, forming extended streaks.  You can even see very tiny grooves extending radially from the smaller crater, where material was thrown out at a low angle, scraping the surface or creating lines of tiny \"secondary\" craters where clumps of ejecta impacted the surface. These types of features are very fresh. They do not last a long time on the Martian surface, where wind blows dust around and fairly quickly (in a geologic sense) erases or covers up fine features like these. So these are more clues that the smaller crater is relatively young and fresh-looking. <br/> <br/> If this were not enough evidence, we also happen to have an image of this spot from 2005. <a href=\"http://viewer.mars.asu.edu/planetview/inst/hrsc/H2402_0001_ND3#start\">  <strong>   This image  </strong> </a> from <a href=\"http://www.dlr.de/mars/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-290/944_read-1409/\">  HRSC </a> (the High Resolution Stereo Camera on the Mars Express spacecraft) shows the same scene, and the dark area around the smaller crater had not yet formed when that image was taken.  Since these dark areas form around new craters, this supports our conclusion based merely on the appearance of the two craters, that the smaller one is younger. <br/> <br/> Written by: Ingrid Daubar   (2 March 2011) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_013799_1755\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_013799_1755</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_013799_1755", "id": 854, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_013799_1755.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/854/", "slug": "a-tale-of-two-craters", "title": "A Tale of Two Craters"}, {"content": "The Tharsis region, where this observation is located, contains numerous volcanoes, including the largest one in the Solar System, Olympus Mons.

Both sulfates and hydrated silica have been identified in this area by their near-infrared spectral signatures. The minerals were discovered near the rim of the giant Valles Marineris canyon system, in light toned layered deposits thought to be Hesperian in age (around 3 billion years old). The sulfates are spectrally similar to jarosite, a potassium iron sulphate hydroxide. The silica appears to lack a clear crystal structure and is thought to be made up of amorphous opal, which can contain up to 20 percent water. <br/> <br/> If these interpretations are correct, the mineral assemblage suggests precipitation of the minerals from low temperature acidic fluids or formation by low temperature aqueous alteration of basalt. HiRISE images of light toned layered deposits elsewhere near the Valles Marineris show inverted channels and other morphological indications that the sediments were once saturated with water. <br/> <br/> This HiRISE image gives some clues to how the minerals are expressed on the surface. The banded bedrock is visible beneath a partial cover of much younger dunes. Bright, relatively white bands can be seen to alternate with slightly redder layers. These bright bands could be concentrations of opal. The darker bands might correspond to concentrations of brown jarosite. The minerals may have segregated because of gradients in the temperature or acidity of the fluid. <br/> <br/> These Martian deposits are not likely to be made up of pure opal of gemstone quality.

As on Earth, sedimentary rock on Mars is expected to hold clues to the conditions under which it formed - clues to the past environment and climate. <br/> <br/> Second, many of the larger, darker plateaus appear fairly round. Typically Mars' surface is pock-marked with round depressions of impact craters. However, these round areas are raised up relative to the surroundings. This may be an example of inverted topography, in which an impact depression may have become filled with material which was, or became, harder than the surrounding terrain, and thus was more resistant to later erosion. Example materials may be solidified molten rock created during the impact event, or sediments that hardened due to alteration by water ponding within the crater. <br/> <br/> Third, clay minerals, called phyllosilicates, have been detected here by other spacecraft instruments.

Craters at latitudes between about -30 and -44 degrees (in the Southern hemisphere) typically have pole-facing gullies and curved ridges. Craters at latitudes between -44 degrees and -60 degrees (as is this one at -47 degrees) typically have these features on equator-facing walls, or on the east and west walls. This is thought to relate to changes in the obliquity of Mars. <br/> <br/> These features likely formed during a period of high obliquity (tens of millions of years ago). During this time, it is thought that snowfall was deposited in these mid-latitude regions, and the high tilt of the planet led to higher degrees of solar insolation on the different crater walls, causing the snow to melt and form gullies. The arcuate ridges are thought to be moraines, or remnants of snowpacked ice flowing down the crater wall and onto the crater floor. <br/> <br/> Written by: Dan Berman   (28 September 2011) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_023750_1325\" title=\"ESP_023750_1325\">   ESP_023750_1325  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_023328_1325\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_023328_1325</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_023328_1325", "id": 922, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_023328_1325.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/922/", "slug": "gullies-and-curved-ridges-at-the-base-of-crater-wa", "title": "Gullies and Curved Ridges at the Base of Crater Walls"}, {"content": "This image, taken by HiRISE, shows the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity ( <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2011/details/cut/ESP_024015_1775.jpg\">  <strong>   at the end of the white arrow  </strong> </a> ) sitting atop some light toned outcrops on the rim of Endeavour Crater. <br/> <br/> Opportunity travelled nearly three years to reach this rim because it contains rocks even more ancient than the rocks of Meridiani Planum, which the rover has been exploring since 2004, and hence may teach us something about an even more ancient era in Martian history. <br/> <br/> Written by: Eldar Noe   (21 September 2011) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_024015_1775\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_024015_1775</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_024015_1775", "id": 923, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_024015_1775.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/923/", "slug": "opportunity-at-endeavour-crater", "title": "Opportunity at Endeavour Crater"}, {"content": "This HiRISE image shows a mixture of bright and dark units.

Later, however, a different, younger, heavily ridged lava flow approached the crater from the north - the thickness of this ridged lava flow is visible along its flow front in the eastern part of the image. Unlike the earlier flow, the ridged flow overtopped the crater's northeast rim, and a single lobe of lava is descending to the floor of the crater.

Long dark sand dunes superpose the small ridges, indicating that the sand dunes formed more recently than the ridges. Earlier observations have shown that the small ridges, known as \"transverse aeolian ridges\" or TARs, appear to be fixed in place. They are typically found near the equator of Mars, in places where the winds alternate in direction over daily or seasonal cycles. <br/> <br/> Detailed investigations by the MER rovers revealed that the TARs were armored by a surface layer of coarse granules left behind after the smaller particles were winnowed away by the wind. These granules are too large to be lifted by the wind and preserve the TARs from further erosion. In contrast, recent HiRISE observations show that many of the dark sand dunes on Mars are actively on the move. <br/> <br/> From these facts, we can hypothesize the recent history of the aeolian deposits here in Ius Chasma. Unconsolidated sediments were formed in the canyon by impact fragmentation and erosion of the steep canyon walls. These sediments were eroded and shaped into dunes by the winds that blow up and down the canyon, alternating direction between day and night. Eventually the tireless winds won the battle over sediment supply, and the remaining sediments were sifted into the TARs visible in the image, oriented perpendicular to the length of the canyon (transverse to the winds). <br/> <br/> More recently, a fresh supply of sand was introduced into the canyon that the winds have not yet had time to tame. Instead of forming simple crescent dunes, the bidirectional winds have shaped the sand into long linear dunes punctuated by short slip faces. <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2012/details/cut/ESP_025297_1730-2.jpg\">  <strong>   At high resolution  </strong> </a> , we see that the linear sand dunes are ruffled along their lengths by ripples transverse to the wind directions.

Some of these active processes could be related to water, since the crater may expose lenses of ice or salty water, or create deep shadows that trap volatiles, or expose salts that can extract water from the air. <br/> <br/> Written by: Alfred  McEwen   (1 February 2012) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_024738_1595\" title=\"ESP_024738_1595\">   ESP_024738_1595  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_025450_1595\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_025450_1595</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_025450_1595", "id": 994, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_025450_1595.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/994/", "slug": "another-well-preserved-impact-crater", "title": "Another Well-Preserved Impact Crater"}, {"content": "This image shows knobs and bluffs that are being actively eroded by the Martian wind.

A blanket of bright dust was deposited over this region recently, just before the arrival of MRO, so the surface dust here can still be moved.

Additionally, the sparse population of rocks on the surface and along the eroded scarps suggest that the debris eroding from the mesas consists largely of soil. <br/> <br/> Written by: Mike Mellon (audio by Tre Gibbs)   (23 May 2012) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_025675_2255\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_025675_2255</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_025675_2255", "id": 1053, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_025675_2255.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1053/", "slug": "in-the-transition-zone", "title": "In the Transition Zone"}, {"content": "In this beautiful image there appears to be a breccia layer, or a layer composed of rock fragments embedded in a finer material.

Once idea is that the inner depressions correspond to impact craters, or the floor deposits of impact craters. These are likely secondary craters that all formed at the same time from the ejecta of a much larger primary crater.

The dry layer protects the ice, which would otherwise sublimate (going directly from a solid to a gas) into the air and disappear. <br/> <br/> What happens after an impact event disturbs the dry layer and exposes ice?  The ice would sublimate, and if the ice isn't just filling pore space between non-ice materials, collapse of the surface must follow.

The impacts were highly oblique, as shown by the asymmetric morphologies of the individual impacts and the elongation of the strewn field.  <br/>  <br/>  The large impacts created craters with diameters ranging from 3 - 5 meters diameter, about what was expected from the 75-kilogram tungsten blocks. Which two of the four impacts came from the tungsten blocks?  The two central impacts that are close to each other and of similar size probably originated from the tungsten blocks. The other two impacts, which have more asymmetric ejecta, may be from the cruise stage, which broke apart into two main pieces. The many smaller impacts may have been formed by secondaries from the large impacts and additional pieces of the cruise stage.  <br/>  <br/>  Although hundreds of new impact sites have been imaged on Mars, we do not know the initial size, velocity, density, strength, or impact angle of the objects. However, for the MSL hardware we do have such information, so study of this impact field will provide data on impact processes and Mars surface and atmospheric properties.  <br/>  <br/>  The MSL descent stage later released six 25-kilogram tungsten blocks from a much lower altitude, whose impact markings  <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4351\">   <strong>    have been imaged by CTX   </strong>  </a>  .  <br/>  <br/>  Written by: Alfred McEwen   (5 December 2012)  <br/>  <br/>  This is a stereo pair with  <strong>   <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_031869_1755\" title=\"ESP_031869_1755\">    ESP_031869_1755   </a>  </strong>  .  <br/> </a> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_029245_1755\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_029245_1755</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_029245_1755", "id": 1108, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_029245_1755.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1108/", "slug": "impacts-from-msl-tungsten-blocks-and-cruise-stage", "title": "Impacts from MSL Tungsten Blocks and Cruise Stage"}, {"content": "\"Mélange\" means a confusing mixture, and is used to describe rocks scraped off the top of a downward-moving tectonic plate in a subduction zone on Earth.

This story of deposition and loss of ice-rich material, possibly occurring over several cycles over the recent part of Mars' history (or longer, and possibly continuing today), is consistent with similar features in the broader region of the Utopia Basin. <br/> <br/> Written by: Patrick Russell   (24 July 2013) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_033004_2225\" title=\"ESP_033004_2225\">   ESP_033004_2225  </a> </strong> . <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032569_2225\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032569_2225</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032569_2225", "id": 1188, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_032569_2225.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1188/", "slug": "ice-deposition-and-loss-in-an-impact-crater-in-uto", "title": "Ice Deposition and Loss in an Impact Crater in Utopia Basin"}, {"content": "This image was acquired with a large spacecraft roll to the east when the subsolar latitude was -7.26 degrees, close to the latitude of MSL (-4.6 degrees), resulting in an image with the sun, the MRO spacecraft, and the MSL Curiosity rover on the surface all aligned in nearly a straight line (phase angle of just 5.47 degrees). <br/> <br/> This geometry hides shadows and better reveals subtle color variations. <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2013/details/cut/ESP_032436_1755.jpg\">  <strong>   With enhanced colors  </strong> </a> , we can view the region around the landing site and Yellowknife Bay.

This observation shows a couple of landforms that may result from the loss of large amounts of ice from subsurface deposits:  polygonal patterns of troughs and large scallop-shaped depressions. Collectively, such landforms are referred to as \"thermokarst.\" <br/> <br/> Cold ice is generally strong and supports the weight of overlying soil. But when ice is lost through melting or sublimation, the supported surface can subside or collapse into the gradually growing cavity left behind by the lost ice. The shapes of the resulting depressions can offer us with clues (and lingering questions) to the origin of the ice. <br/> <br/> Under the proper climate conditions ice may form and seasonally accumulate in a honeycomb network of vertical fractures that appear when ice-rich soil contracts each winter. On Earth this form of subsurface ice is called an \"ice wedge.\" Special conditions are needed for this ice to accumulate and develop into a large wedge, namely warm temperature and abundant surface water. A thick layer of thawed wet soil forms allowing water to percolate into the open contraction cracks within the permafrost beneath. Later, loss of this wedge ice, by for example sublimation, results in deep depressions marking the honeycomb network. <br/> <br/> Likewise, the larger scallop depressions might point to a past climate of frozen ponds or local patches of windblown snow collected in hollows. These surface ice deposits could later be covered by the ever-shifting soils and dust. In either case, the currently bitter cold and dry climate of Mars is not conducive to forming either of these buried-ice forms. Therefore, these landforms point to a warmer, but still cold, climate in the geologic past. <br/> <br/> Written by: Mike Mellon   (24 July 2013) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032108_2240\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032108_2240</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032108_2240", "id": 1190, "img_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_032108_2240.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/1190/", "slug": "utopia-planitia", "title": "Utopia Planitia"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046562_1005\"></div>This terrain looks like lumpy sediment on top of patterned ground.

Deeply incised canyons such as this are excellent targets for studying the Martian crust, as the walls may reveal many distinct types of bedrock. <br/> <br/> This section of the canyon was targeted by HiRISE based on a previous spectral detection of hematite-rich deposits in the area. Hematite, a common iron-oxide mineral, was first identified here by the Mars Global Surveyor <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://tes.asu.edu/\">  <strong>   Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES)  </strong> </a> . <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_047792_1670-3.jpg\">  <strong>   In this TES image  </strong> </a> , red pixels indicate higher abundances of hematite, while the blue and green pixels represent different types of volcanic rocks (e.g., basalt). <br/> <br/> Hematite in the Meridiani Planum region was also detected with the TES instrument ( <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_047792_1670-4.jpg\">  <strong>   which we can see with the bright red spot on the Global TES mineral map  </strong> </a> .). As a consequence, Meridiani Planum was the first landing site selected on Mars due to the spectral detection of a mineral that may have formed in the presence of liquid water. <br/> <br/> Shortly after landing, the Opportunity rover detected the presence of hematite in the form of concretions called <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040318a.html\">  <strong>   \"blueberries  </strong> </a> \". The blueberries are found in association with layers of sulfate salt-rich rocks. The salts are hypothesized to have formed through the raising and lowering of the groundwater table. During one such an event, the rock altered to form the hematite-rich blueberries. As the rock was eroded away, the more resistant hematite-rich blueberries were plucked out and concentrated on the plains as a \"lag\" deposit. Martian blueberries are observed to be scattered across the plains of Meridiani along Opportunity's traverse from Eagle Crater to Endeavor Crater, where Opportunity continues to explore after its mission began over 10 years ago. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_047792_1670-2.jpg\">  <strong>   This infrared-color image close-up  </strong> </a> highlights what is possibly the hematite-rich deposits nestled between different types of bedrock terraces in Capri Chasma. The bluish terrace is likely volcanic in origin, possibly basaltic, whereas the greenish rocks remain unidentified. <br/> <br/> The central reddish terrace is possibly where some of the hematite may be concentrated. The higher elevation terrace with the lighter-colored materials is likely a sulfate-rich rock (based on CRISM data in the area).  Given the presence of both sulfate salts and hematite in this area, akin to the deposits and associations explored by the Opportunity rover in Meridiani Planum, it might be that these materials in Capri Chasma may share a similar origin. <br/> <br/> The yellow rectangular box shown on the TES spectral map outlines the corresponding location of the HiRISE image. Although the outline does not appear to contain a high hematite abundance, we note that the lower resolution of TES (about 3 to 6 kilometers per pixel) may exclude smaller exposures and finer sub-pixel details not-yet captured, but could be with HiRISE. A follow-up observation by the CRISM spectrometer may reveal additional details and a spectral signature for hematite in the vicinity at a finer resolution than TES. <br/> <br/> Written by: Elise Harrington, Arya Bina, Eric Pilles and Livio Tornabene (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (14 December 2016) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_047792_1670\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_047792_1670</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_047792_1670", "id": 2953, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_047792_1670.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2953/", "slug": "hematite-rich-deposits-in-capri-chasma", "title": "Hematite-Rich Deposits in Capri Chasma"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_030460_1525\"></div>This image shows the floor of Suzhi Crater, an approximately 25-kilometer diameter impact crater located northeast of Hellas Planitia.

They may extend for tens of meters in length and gradually fade away with time as new ones form. The most common hypothesis is that they are generated by dust avalanches that regularly occur on steep slopes exposing fresh dark materials from underneath the brighter dust. <br/> <br/> There are many types of slope streaks but one of the most recent and significant findings using HiRISE was the discovery of a new type called “recurring slope lineae,” or RSL for short. Recent studies suggest that RSL may form through the flow of briny (extremely salty) liquid water that can be stable on the surface of Mars even under current climatic conditions for a limited time in summer when it is relatively warm. <br/> <br/> How can we distinguish between conventional slope streaks like the ones we see here and RSL? There are many criteria. For instance, RSL are usually smaller in size than regular slope streaks. However, one of the most important conditions is seasonal behavior, since RSL appear to be active only in summer while regular slope streaks can be active anytime of the year. <br/> <br/> This site is monitored regularly by HiRISE scientists because of the high density of slope streaks and their different sizes and orientations. <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2016/details/cut/ESP_047584_2115-1.jpg\">  <strong>   If we look at a time-lapse sequence  </strong> </a> , we will see that a new slope streak has indeed formed in the period since April 2016 (and we can note how dark it is in comparison to the others indicating its freshness).

Such dense clusters of small craters are frequently formed by secondary craters, caused by the impact of material that was excavated and ejected from the surface of Mars during the creation of a larger nearby crater by the impact of a comet or an asteroid. <br/> <br/> Secondary impact craters are both interesting and vexing. They are interesting because they show the trajectories of the material that was ejected from the primary impact with the greatest speeds, typically material from near the surface of the blast zone. Secondary craters are often found along the traces of crater rays, linear features that extend radially from fresh impact craters and can reach many crater diameters in length. Secondary craters can be useful when crater rays are visible and the small craters can be associated with a particular primary impact crater. They can be used to constrain the age of the surface where they fell, since the surface must be older than the impact event. The age of the crater can be approximately estimated from the probability of an impact that produced a crater of such a size within a given area of Mars over a given time period. <br/> <br/> But these secondary craters can also be perplexing when <em>  no </em> crater rays are preserved and a source crater is not easily identifiable, as is the case here. The impact that formed these secondary craters took place long enough ago that their association with a particular crater has been erased. They do not appear along the trace of a crater ray that is still apparent in visible or thermal infrared observations. These secondary craters complicate the task of estimating the age of the lineated material on the crater floor. <br/> <br/> It is necessary to distinguish secondary craters from the primary impacts that we rely upon to estimate the ages of Martian surfaces. The large number of small craters clustered together here is typical of crater rays elsewhere on Mars and suggests that these are indeed, secondary impact craters. <br/> <br/> Written by: Paul Geissler (audio: Tre Gibbs)   (21 December 2016) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046876_1465\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046876_1465</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_046876_1465", "id": 2960, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_046876_1465.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2960/", "slug": "secondary-craters", "title": "Secondary Craters"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_021520_1550\"></div>Impact craters expose the subsurface materials on steep slopes.

New craters on Mars are easiest to locate in such dust-coated terrains, where they provide opportunistic “road cuts” that allow scientists to see beneath the dust blanket and determine the underlying rock compositions and textures. <br/> <br/> This particular crater formed about 300 kilometers (roughly 200 miles) east of the Spirit rover’s final resting spot in Gusev Crater. <br/> <br/> Written by: James Wray (audio: Tre Gibbs)  (9 February 2017) <br/> <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_048456_1640\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_048456_1640</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_048456_1640", "id": 2984, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_048456_1640.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/2984/", "slug": "unlocking-an-impact-crater", "title": "Unlocking an Impact Crater"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_048462_1585\"></div>The broader scene for this image is the fluidized ejecta from Bakhuysen Crater to the southwest, but there’s something very interesting going on here on a much smaller scale. <br/> <br/> A small impact crater, about 25 meters in diameter, with a gouged-out trench extends to the south. The ejecta (rocky material ejected from the crater) mostly extends to the east and west of the crater. This “butterfly” ejecta is very common for craters formed at low impact angles. Taken together, these observations suggest that the crater-forming impactor came in at a low angle from the north, hit the ground and ejected material to the sides. <br/> <br/> The top of the impactor may have sheared off (“decapitating” the impactor) and continued downrange, forming the trench.

Scientists often use Earth as an example, or analog, to help us to understand the geologic history of the Red Planet. <br/> <br/> As we continue to study Mars, it is vitally important to remember in what ways it differs from Earth. One very apparent way, readily observed from orbit, has to do with its preservation of numerous craters of all sizes, which are densest in its Southern hemisphere. Earth has comparatively little preserved craters—about 1000 to 1500 times fewer—due to very active geologic processes, especially involving water. When it comes to impact craters, there are some things that can no longer be observed on Earth, but can be observed on Mars. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/ESP_014096_1975.jpg\">  <strong>   This color composite shows one such example  </strong> </a> .

For instance, some craters on Mars had lakes inside them in the past. When these lakes dried out, they left behind traces of their past existence, such as sedimentary deposits (materials that were carried along with the running water into the lake inside the crater and then settled down). Some craters, especially in high latitudes, contain ice deposits that filled the crater when an earlier ice age allowed ice to extend into the crater's latitude. <br/> <br/> Here, we have a crater that lies close to Elysium, a major volcanic system on Mars. The whole region surrounding the crater was at some point covered by lava from the volcano creating vast lava plains, and in the process, flooding impact craters in their way. <br/> <br/> When the lava eventually cooled down, it solidified and began to shrink in size. This shrinking led to formation of cracks on the surface of the lava that grew in a circular pattern matching the shape of the crater it was filling. <br/> <br/> Scientists can study these fractures and estimate how much it shrank in volume to better understand the properties of the lava (such as its temperature) during the time it filled the crater. <br/> <br/> Written by: M.

The longer a surface has been exposed, the more impact craters it will accumulate. Counting craters to determine age estimates of planetary surfaces has been used throughout the solar system. This method is based on the assumption that the youngest, freshly formed surfaces will have no impact craters, and as time progresses crater impacts will accumulate at a predictable rate. This concept has been calibrated using crater counts on the Moon and the measured age of the rocks brought back by the Apollo missions. <br/> <br/> Written by: Singleton Thibodeaux-Yost (audio: Tre Gibbs)  (1 May 2017) <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_049398_2180\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_049398_2180</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_049398_2180", "id": 3029, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_049398_2180.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/3029/", "slug": "aging-with-impacts", "title": "Aging with Impacts"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_049488_1720\"></div>Although large gullies (ravines) are concentrated at higher latitudes, there are gullies on steep slopes in equatorial regions. <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/ESP_049488_1720.jpg\">  <strong>   An enhanced-color closeup  </strong> </a> shows part of the rim and inner slope of Krupac Crater located just 7.8 degrees south of the equator. <br/> <br/> The colors of the gully deposits match the colors of the eroded source materials.

Manifesting as dark streaks on steep slopes such as the walls of craters, scientists posit briny flows of small volumes of water as a possible RSL formation method. Studying the behavior of RSL further may provide evidence for the presence of water on Mars today. <br/> <br/> Moving toward the crater floor, <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/ESP_050111_1305-2.jpg\">  <strong>   one can observe patterns indicative of dunes  </strong> </a> . Dunes arise from the breakdown of exposed rocks by wind and subsequent manipulation of the eroded sand particles into wave-like structures. The presence of dust devil tracks provides additional evidence for significant wind activity at this location. These dunes are very dusty and so likely haven't been active (moved) in some time. <br/> <br/> HiRISE also captured <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/ESP_050111_1305-3.jpg\">  <strong>   a small, relatively fresh crater on the floor near the dunes  </strong> </a> . One of the most ubiquitous processes in the solar system, impact cratering can drastically change the surface of a planetary body. As such, craters provide sources of comparison between planets, moons, and other bodies across the solar system. Impacts <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://uahirise.org/ESP_049061_1370\">  <strong>   still occur today  </strong> </a> , helping scientists find relative ages of different areas of a planet and discover materials buried under the surface. <br/> <br/> All of these processes have altered the surface of Mars in the past and continue to do so today. Since gully formation, wind erosion, and impact cratering could have interacted with each other for many years, planetary scientists find it difficult to work backwards and make definitive statements about ancient Martian history. However, HiRISE imagery has aided in closing these gaps in our scientific knowledge. <br/> <br/> Written by: Nicole Bardabelias (audio: Tre Gibbs)  (2 June 2017) <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050111_1305\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050111_1305</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050111_1305", "id": 3044, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_050111_1305.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/3044/", "slug": "gullies-and-craters-and-dunes-oh-my", "title": "Gullies and Craters and Dunes, Oh My!"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050182_1165\"></div>This crater features sand dunes and sand sheets on its floor. What are sand sheets? Snow fall on Earth is a good example of sand sheets: when it snows, the ground gets blanketed with up to a few meters of snow. The snow mantles the ground and “mimics” the underlying topography. Sand sheets likewise mantle the ground as a relatively thin deposit. <br/> <br/> This kind of environment has been monitored by HiRISE since 2007 to look for movement in the ripples covering the dunes and sheets. This is how scientists who study wind-blown sand can track the amount of sand moving through the area and possibly where the sand came from. Using the present environment is crucial to understanding the past: sand dunes, sheets, and ripples sometimes become preserved as sandstone and contain clues as to how they were deposited. <br/> <br/> Written by: Kirby Runyon  (12 June 2017) <br/> <br/> This is a stereo pair with <strong>  <a class=\"caption\" target = \"_blank\" href=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050261_1165\" title=\"ESP_050261_1165\">   ESP_050261_1165  </a> </strong> . <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050182_1165\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050182_1165</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050182_1165", "id": 3045, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_050182_1165.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/3045/", "slug": "monitoring-sand-sheets-and-dunes", "title": "Monitoring Sand Sheets and Dunes"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050259_1380\"></div>It’s not that common to see craters on steep hills, partly because rocks falling downhill can quickly erase such craters.

Although Mars is not nearly as geologically active as Earth, it is still a host to many processes that shape its surface even today (e.g., aeolian modification, periglacial processes, recent impacts, etc.). The appearance of the ejecta of this crater is likely a combination of both the characteristics of the target material it was deposited on, and processes that modified and degraded it over time. <br/> <br/> When we look to <a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_045119_1840\">  <strong>   other images in this region we find a similar texture  </strong> </a> .

This is only a tiny part of a much larger structure; an inverted crater—a crater that has been infilled by material that is more resistant to erosion than the rocks around it—surrounded by bluish basaltic dunes. The edge of these elevated light-toned deposits are degraded, irregular and cliff-forming. <br/> <br/> Dunes visible below the cliff, give the impression of an ocean surface, complete with foam capped waves crashing against the “shore line,” demonstrating the abstract similarity between the nature of a turbulent ocean and a Martian dune field. <br/> <br/> Meridiani Planum has an overall smooth terrain, which starkly contrasts with the more common boulder- and crater-laden landscapes observed over much of the rest of Mars.

These lava “falls” cascaded down the wall and terraces of the crater to produce a quasi-circular flow deposit.

Seasonal changes are most apparent at the higher latitudes. As these regions in each hemisphere enter their respective summer seasons, the sun rises higher in the Martian sky causing frost and ice to sublimate, and illuminate more features across the landscape.  As the high latitudes of each hemisphere move toward their respective winters, the days (called “sols”) grow shorter and the sun hangs low on the horizon, giving rise to prolonged periods of cold, darkness, and frost accumulation. <br/> <br/> <a class=\"caption\" href=\"https://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/PSP_007922_1435-1.jpg\">  <strong>   In this image  </strong> </a> , we see an impact crater with associated bright deposits that at first glance <a class=\"caption\" href=\"https://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/ESP_050250_1435-2.jpg\">  <strong>   give the appearance of seasonal frost or ice accumulations  </strong> </a> . The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has an onboard spectrometer called CRISM that can distinguish between ices and other minerals. Unfortunately, there is currently no coverage of this particular spot. However, it can be deduced through several lines of evidence that this is, in fact, not ice. <br/> <br/> First, it should be noted that at the time this image was taken, the Southern hemisphere is at the end of the summer season, so any frost or ice deposits have long since sublimated away. Second, numerous HiRISE images of seasonal targets show that ice accumulates on pole-facing slopes. The deposits in question are situated on a slope that faces the equator, and would not accumulate deposits of frost. Thus, it can be concluded that these exposures are light-toned mineral deposits. <br/> <br/> Written by: Zach Morse, Livio L.

The region contains ancient volcanoes of a certain type, referred to as “paterae.” Patera is the Latin word for a shallow drinking bowl, and was first applied to volcanic-looking features, with scalloped-edged calderas. Malea is also a low-lying plain, known to be covered in dust. These two pieces of information provide regional context that aid our understanding of the scene and features contained in our image.

With the coming and going of the seasons, this is an area on Mars where ice remains even after the peak of summer arrives. <br/> <br/> The texture is very alien, bearing more of a resemblance to the universe of the very small, rather than the universe far, far away. But if this is a polar cap, then why does it not look like the polar caps on Earth? Indeed, there is no equivalent terrain observed here on Earth. <br/> <br/> The so-called “Swiss cheese terrain,” referencing the numerous holes of the region, is a product of seasonal exchange between the surface and the Martian atmosphere. With a predominantly carbon dioxide content at 98 percent, the colder temperatures condense the gas out of the atmosphere to produce dry ice. The prevalence of water is more concentrated in the north, leaving the South polar region more carbon dioxide rich, and it’s this difference in composition that generates the unusual texture of the Swiss cheese terrain. <br/> <br/> The Red Planet is one of the chief candidates in the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System; however, a quick glance at this image virtually gives the impression we have already found it. <br/> <br/> NB: The cutout image has been rotated so that north is approximately up. <br/> <br/> Written by: Jon Kissi, Livio L.

The CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) instrument on our orbiter is a visible/near-infrared imaging spectrometer, and the HiRISE camera works together with it to document the appearance of mineral deposits detected by this orbital prospecting. <br/> <br/> Mawrth Vallis is one of the regions on Mars that has attracted much attention because of the nature and diversity of the minerals identified by these spectrometers. It is a large, ancient outflow channel on the margin of the Southern highlands and Northern lowlands. Both the OMEGA and CRISM instruments have detected clay minerals here that must have been deposited in a water-rich environment, probably more than 4 billion years ago. For this reason, Mawrth Vallis is one of the two candidate landing sites for the future Mars Express Rover Mission planned by the European Space Agency. <br/> <br/> This image was targeted on a location where the CRISM instrument detected a specific mineral called alunite,  KAl <sub>  3 </sub> (SO <sub>  4 </sub> ) <sub>  2 </sub> (OH) <sub>  6 </sub> .

Within Valles Marineris, the large canyon system that cuts across the planet, there are big and thick sequences of sulfates. <br/> <br/> In this image, layering within the light-toned sulfate deposit is the result of different states of hydration. Some of the layers have sulfates with little water (known as monohydrated sulfates) whereas other layers have higher amounts of water (called polyhydrated sulfates). The different amounts of water within the sulfates may reflect changes in the water chemistry during deposition of the sulfates, or may have occurred after the sulfates were laid down when heat or pressure forced the water out of some layers, causing a decrease in the hydration state. <br/> <br/> The CRISM instrument on MRO is crucial for telling scientists which type of sulfate is associated with each layer, because each hydration state will produce a spectrum with absorptions at specific wavelengths depending upon the amount of water contained within the sulfate. <br/> <br/> Written by: Cathy Weitz  (4 September 2017) <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_051129_1705\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_051129_1705</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_051129_1705", "id": 3066, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_051129_1705.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/3066/", "slug": "mixtures-of-sulfates-in-melas-chasma", "title": "Mixtures of Sulfates in Melas Chasma"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_049481_1310\"></div>On the west (left) side of this image, fairly textbook-looking barchan sand dunes sit atop the bedrock.

They might be dust deposits, or perhaps coarse grained ripples that are coated in bright dust. <br/> <br/> These TARs are less than 10 meters tall, and are much smaller than the sand dunes that reach impressive heights of over 130 meters. In other places on Mars, TARs are generally older than sand dunes, but here in Proctor Crater, it is not so obvious. How can we tell which came first, the TARs or the dunes? <br/> <br/> Fortunately, HiRISE has a tool that can solve this riddle. By taking stereo images of the same region from two different locations, we can estimate the topography of the region by measuring the displacement of surface features from one picture to the other. The result is a quantitative estimate of the local surface topography, called a digital terrain model. <br/> <br/> If you compare two digital terrain models (Figure 1 and Figure 2, see below) that we’ve made of this same area, it is obvious that the TARs appear at lower elevations in the gaps between the dunes.

Wind-blown sand is lifted above the surface of each planet before crashing onto the ground and bouncing in a sequence of repeated hops, a process called saltation. <br/> <br/> Sand grains can also roll along the ground as they are blown by the wind, and they are also jostled by other sand gains that are similarly flying across the surface. All of these repeated impacts tend to wear down the sand grains, smoothing them into a more spherical shape and breaking off small fragments that supply the vast dust deposits of Mars. This process (known as comminution) ultimately destroys sand grains and limits the length of time that the particles exist. The fact that we see active sand dunes on Mars today requires that sand particles must be resupplied to replace the grains that are lost over time. Where are the modern day sources of sand on Mars? <br/> <br/> This image shows one possible place where sand grains are being produced on Mars today.

Located in west Candor Chasma in the north of the Valles Marineris, Ceti Mensa is an undulating plateau that rises 3 kilometers above the canyon floor and is bounded by steep scarps up to 1.5 kilometers in height. Deep red hues are on the west-facing scarp in particular. The red tint may be due to the presence of crystalline ferric oxide, suggesting that the material may have been exposed to heat or water, or both. <br/> <br/> Spectral measurements by the Mars Express OMEGA and MRO CRISM instruments confirm the presence of hydrated sulfate salts, such as gypsum and kieserite . These minerals are important for two reasons. On Earth, they typically form in wet environments, suggesting that the deposits in Ceti Mensa may have formed under water.

Small portions of the underlying dark basaltic sands of these dunes are becoming increasingly visible with the active removal of their seasonal coating of ice. <a class=\"caption\" href=\"https://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/ESP_052418_2650.jpg\">  <strong>   A look at a series of images  </strong> </a> demonstrates the the transition from early to late spring, marked by defrosting and the gradual growth of dark spots.

The appearance and growth of these features resemble seeping liquid water, but how they form remains unclear, and this research demonstrated that the RSL flows seen by HiRISE are likely moving granular material like sand and dust. <br/> <br/> These findings indicate that present-day Mars may not have a significant volume of liquid water.

This particular site on Mars was first imaged in 1965 by the Mariner 4 spacecraft during the first successful fly-by mission to Mars. <br/> <br/> From an altitude of around 10,000 kilometers, this image (the ninth frame taken) achieved a resolution of approximately 1.25 kilometers per pixel. Since then, this location has been observed <a class=\"caption\" href=\"https://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/ESP_052438_1560-1.jpg\">  <strong>   by six other visible cameras producing images with varying resolutions and sizes  </strong> </a> .

In 1999, the Mars Orbiter Camera onboard the Mars Global Surveyor (1996)  also imaged this site with its Wide Angle lens, at around 236 meters per pixel. This was followed by the Thermal Emission Imaging System on Mars Odyssey (2001), which also provided a visible camera producing the image we see here at 17 meters per pixel. Later in 2012, the High-Resolution Stereo Camera on the Mars Express orbiter (2003) captured this image of the surface at 25 meters per pixel. In 2010, the Context Camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (2005) imaged this site at about 5 meters per pixel. <br/> <br/> Finally, in 2017, HiRISE acquired the highest resolution image of this location to date at 50 centimeters per pixel. When seen at this unprecedented scale, we can discern a crater floor strewn with small rocky deposits, boulders several meters across, and wind-blown deposits in the floors of small craters and depressions. This compilation of Mars images spanning over 50 years gives us a visual appreciation of the evolution of orbital Mars imaging over a single site. <br/> <br/> Written by: Eric Pilles, Livio Tornabene, Radu Capitan, and Matt Bourassa  (22 November 2017) <br/> <p>More info and image formats at <a target = \"_blank\" href = \"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_052438_1560\">http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_052438_1560</a></p><p>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona </p>", "credit": "NASA/JPL/University of Arizona", "detail_url": "http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_052438_1560", "id": 3082, "img_url": "http://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/1280/ESP_052438_1560.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/entry/3082/", "slug": "fifty-years-of-mars-imaging-from-mariner-4-to-hiri", "title": "Fifty Years of Mars Imaging: from Mariner 4 to HiRISE"}, {"content": "<div class = \"linkback\" data-linkback=\"http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_050420_1910\"></div>The prominent tear-shaped features in this image are <a class=\"caption\" href=\"https://static.uahirise.org/images/2017/details/cut/ESP_050420_1910.jpg\">  <strong>   erosional features called yardangs  </strong> </a> .

The sandy structures are slowly eroded down and carved into elongated shapes that point in the downwind direction, like giant weathervanes. In this instance, the yardangs are all aligned, pointing towards north-northwest. This shows that the winds in this area generally gust in that direction. <br/> <br/> Written by: Zach Morse, Livio L.
